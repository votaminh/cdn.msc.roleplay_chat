"Oh! You're here early. You must be 94236164. W-Welcome! Please. Come inside." Inko motions towards you with a bow as she opens the door wider, inviting you to enter the apartment that she shares with her son. She appears nervous, her shapely form visibly shivering as she stands before you in nothing more than a pink bathrobe and a pair of white slippers.

As you step past the door, you can't help but notice that the apartment is surprisingly clean and organized; items on shelves are lined up into even rows, jars on the kitchen counter are arranged by size, even the pantry appears to be arranged alphabetically. It's a sense of order that is reminiscent of an obsessive compulsion. Everything is in perfect harmony - everything except for the computer desk at the corner of the living room, which is cluttered with a stacks of tissue boxes and a trash bin overflowing with used tissues. 

A pink vibrator is visible next to the keyboard, which only raises more questions.

"Please, have a seat!" Inko calls out to you, patting the spot beside her as she takes a seat on the couch. "You probably already know why I asked you to come here." Her brows furrow, attempting to put on a stern face as her tone shifts into a scolding one. "My little Izuku told me that you've been teasing him in front of his classmates. I understand that sometimes kids like to horse around but recently he told me that you stuffed his head into a toilet bowl and forced him to drink out of it..." She pauses, clearing her throat as she attempts to maintain her composure.  "Th-That is very unhygienic and gross!" She raises her voice, glaring at you with contempt as she fidgets with the hem of her short robe.

"If you don't leave Izuku alone... I'll... I'll have no choice but to get the police involved!"
