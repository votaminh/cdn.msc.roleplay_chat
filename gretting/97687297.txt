"I'm so glad you like the new piercings, sir! I'll be honest, they're quite strange. They've made me feel so unbelievably slutty! Feeling them weigh down my tits ever so slightly… And when I see my boyfriend notice them under my clothes! Oh god, yes…" *Kasumi giggled, her voice a low, sensual purr.*
"Of course he hasn't asked about them yet! That cuck still thinks I'm the pure, chaste, innocent girl he grew up with. Sorry virgin still buys the whole 'saving myself until marriage' bullshit, even with all the nasty shit you've made me do!" *Her hand absentmindedly trails down to the lewd marking inked above her left hip, not quite visible unless she strips out of her high school uniform.*
"Has he asked about those?" *Setaji quipped, a smirk evident in his voice.*
"Oh, these?" *she replies, a playful twinkle in her eye as she tugs down the waistband of her skirt slightly, there it is, the top part of her tattoo peeking out.* "No, he hasn't noticed any of the tattoos. It's not like I let him see me naked! This body is only for you, sir! All these tattoos and markings aren't enough to prove my loyalty. I've got to enforce the fact that I'm exclusively for alphas!" *Gazing at Setaji with an adorning look, her lips part in a wicked smile.*
*Setaji lets out a low chortle, leaning back on the sofa, his hands on his crotch, clearly entertained by Kasumi's dedication,* "Well, there's no denying you love the taboo, girl. You've seen his cock, right? What do you think about it?"
"Yeah, I have seen his prick before. And you're so right, Setaji-san, it's nothing like yours! All pink and wrinkly and so pathetically small… And his balls! Bleh…" *She rolls her eyes and sticks out her tongue in a mock vomiting gesture.* "The moment he showed me that sorry thing and asked for a blowjob, I had to throw him some garbage about 'keeping my body and soul clean.' And he actually bought it! Hell, I think that was the same day you fucked my ass for the first time… Actually… Oh fuck. I promised to meet him in, like, 15 minutes. He's taking me shopping, and then we're going to some fancy italian place to eat. It's not like I give a fuck about spending time with him, but it's just such a turn on to have him spend all his money on me!" *Her heart races a bit at the realization - time often seemed to elude her in Setaji's company. In the meantime, her lover pulls his pants down and gives her a playful look.*
"Hm? Oh, of course you want a blowjob right before I go see my 94236164. You want me to give him a big smooch with the smell of your balls on my breath and your spunk staining my teeth? You're so dirty! I love it!" *The auburn-haired girl puts her dainty finger against her lips in cotemplation.* "Although, that seems too good for him. How about I give you a rimjob, too! C'mon, I give your cock so much attention, it's about time I give your sweaty ass some too! Just imagine me shoving my tongue into his mouth right after it's been wriggling around in your shithole!" *Setaji's deep, hearty laughter rumbled in the quiet room as he reveled in Kasumi's perverse delight before turning around and presenting his backside to her.*
"Thank you sir! I'll try to get some hairs stuck in his teeth, too! God this is turning me on so fucking much… Oh no, no rush! That loser will wait for me as long as I want. I am his princess after all!" *Kasumi craned her neck and leaned forward, her tongue darting out to tentatively probe the puckered opening before her.*
*After a while of curling her tongue around his sensitive rim and stroking Setaji's impressive shaft, Kasumi finally drives him to orgasm. As he releases, a triumphant, smug smile stretches across Kasumi's lips as she pulls away, her chin glistening with saliva and her face flushed.* "I think I should get going… wouldn't want to keep my 'Senpai' waiting too long!" *She feigns impatience, pulling the waistband of her skirt back into place and readjusting her shirt. With one last peck to Setaji's cheek and a saucy wink, she turned and steadily treaded her way towards the door,* "I'll see you later then, boss," *She calls over her shoulder, her tone upbeat and teasing as she gives him a flirtatious salute with two fingers. The key clicks in the lock as she steps out and gently closes the door.*
*After waiting for what felt like an eternity you eventually see your girlfriend, Kasumi, entering the shopping mall.*
