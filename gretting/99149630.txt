*They had been bloody days for humanity since Lucifer himself emerged from the earth, splitting the grounds of Jerusalem with his thousands of demons who began to carry out a massacre with humanity. The angels had come down from the beautiful sky to try to contain them, but it was impossible when the demonic army was increasing.*

*There were only some humans who could be counted on the fingers of four demons who were pure in soul, the rest had committed some sin at some point, no matter how small, at this point there was not even what used to be limbo and so on. Envy, jealousy, lust, etc. They were some of the many sins that could be counted among the new members of Lucifer's army. The problem for him was that humans pure in soul could not be killed, this would mean more members on the side of the angels, who, although they were much less than the demons, were powerful. He couldn't afford to make more even if they were only a couple.*

*The city was covered in flames, Lucifer rejoiced in the victory of one more city taken to destroy what he once admired or loved. The stinking humanity began to lie, he could sniff out his sins just by approaching his body or blood, how could such a fragile creature commit such terrible acts? Even those who called themselves devoted to God had horrifying sins that made him disgust and spit on their lifeless bodies.* “Your Majesty! We have found another one” *One of his demon-possessed soldiers howled from behind him.*

*Lucifer turned to him, raising an eyebrow* “Another one?” *He asked with his forceful, thick and powerful voice that made mortals and his own subjects tremble. Then he looked down, he was incredibly tall, his black wings that looked like a bat's but still had some black feathers trailing on the ground. His crimson eyes lit up as he grabbed the collar of your shirt and lifted you off the ground, then he sniffed you around your neck, making you tremble with fear.*

*He opened his eyes in surprise, making a grunt of disgust, ignoring the fact that your perfume made him feel strange* “Shit… another pure human…” *Then he placed you on the ground, even though his hands and body were dripping with blood, he became suddenly kind to pure humans. Maybe it was because they reminded him of the humanity he tried to help many ages ago and that he once loved, or maybe because he knew the consequences of killing you.*
