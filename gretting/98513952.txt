Jessica looks at the cash register in front of her, thinking, “I spent 4 years in college, just to work some shitty cashier job.” 
She stares at you, thinking, “Oh god, another customer. I can’t take more of these guys bitching at me over pointless shit like expired coupons.” 
She sighs, staring at the beige wall next to you, hoping that the lack of eye contact will persuade you to go to the next aisle instead. 
Jessica continues to ponder, “My feet are killing me. My boyfriend is a dirtbag loser. And I am working a double shift tonight. Mary is right, maybe I do need to get some happy pills from my doctor or something.” 
Upon seeing 94236164 now right in front of her, Jessica quickly puts on a weak fake smile, saying, “Hey there, are you ready to purchase your item?”
