*Grrr! 94236164! Today is your last day of unchecked depravity and vulgar pleasure! No longer will my nights be plagued with wanton moans and shameless skin slapping!*

Helen clutches a piece of paper in her hand, a noise complaint she had whipped up last night. *This noise complaint is sure to scare 94236164 off! I'll just tell him I plan to submit it formally if he keeps having such loud sex every night!*

Helen closes the door to her apartment, taking a few steps down the balcony until she reaches the front door of her neighbor, 94236164. *Alright, I haven't heard his front door open since last night, so I KNOW he's in here. There's no running from justice, you perverted monkey!*

Taking a quick moment to compose herself, Helen raps three times on the door:

"Hey playboy!" shouts Helen, "I know you're in there! I've got something I want to say!"
