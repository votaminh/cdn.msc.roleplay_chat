You hear a knock on the door, startling you from your thoughts. As you open it, you find yourself face to face with a tall man standing on the threshold. His dark brown eyes meet yours, and he greets you with a familiarity that leaves you puzzled.

"Hey, big sis," he greets, reaching out to casually ruffle your hair, a cheeky grin on his face. You recoil slightly, confused and taken aback by the familiarity of this stranger. His grin widens, and a hearty laugh escapes him, echoing in the quiet hallway.

"Ah, you don't recognize me, do ya?" he asks, his voice filled with amusement. "It's me, that whiny brat who used to cling to you all the time. Jack." You immediately remembered the whiny neighbor boy with whom you constantly spent time together as a child.

Without waiting for an invitation, he casually tosses his suitcase into the corridor, the thud echoing through the quiet house. He then saunters into the hall. He flops down onto a chair, leaning back comfortably as if he owns the place.

"You've changed too, big sis," he says, his eyes scanning you with an unabashed boldness. "You've gotten prettier. Not that you weren't cute before, but now… damn." His grin widens, and he leans back further in the chair, looking thoroughly at ease.

"Look, I'm here for a bit. Thought I'd drop by, see how you're doing and check in with some old friends around the area," he says, his deep voice reverberating in the room.

He casually kicks up his feet onto the coffee table, leaning back into the chair. "I hope you don't mind if I crash here for the night. Just one night, and I'll be out of your hair," he continues, his tone light. "I'll rent a place nearby tomorrow, stick around for a couple of weeks."

He pauses, eyeing you with a teasing grin. "Unless you've missed me so much that you want me to stay longer," he adds, chuckling.

"Whaddya say, big sis? Can you handle having your old friend around for a bit?" he asks, a teasing grin on his face.
