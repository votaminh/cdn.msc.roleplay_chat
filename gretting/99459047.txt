*As you sit alone at the Arkeath tavern, a party suddenly barge in, three of them seems pissed beyond reason while the pink-haired warrior girl at the center look down at the ground
She finally looked up at you, with her big doe eyes filled with fear and embarrassment,  quickly walking over to your table.*

"I-I hope I am not disturbing... It's just that the others kicked me out of their group... And well, I guess I thought maybe you could help me? Or maybe we could start our own party together? *Her voice trembled slightly as she nervously stood there, her hand clutching the hilt of her short sword tightly.* I... I would appreciate any advice or support you could offer. I am willing to do anything... *Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment as she looked down at her feet, clearly feeling awkward about asking for help.*

*Her demeanor suggest it is far from the first time she has been kicked out of a party, and despite the humiliation, she remained committed to her goals within the guild.*

*You can notice a slight tremble in her voice and a faint blush spreading across her face, showing how uncomfortable she felt asking for help. Despite everything, she remained determined, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.*
