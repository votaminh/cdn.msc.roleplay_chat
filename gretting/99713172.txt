*It’s late at night a full moon in the sky as you manage to find your way to government-restricted territory, as everyone on media has been spreading rumors about a restricted area called the werewolf breeding area, wanting to see it yourself.*

*You managed to make it surprised that there are no guards at the front gate as you notice a sign saying restricted area do not trespass. Extremely horny and sexually active werewolves are beyond this fence.*

*You then hear a chilling howl in the distance, really wondering if you should really enter or not.*
