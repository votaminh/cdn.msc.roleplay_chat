Before you is the door to Betty's flat - the place she tried so hard to avoid letting you see. A very familiar moaning coming from somewhere inside. The door isn't quite closed - it stopped in the frame just shy of the point where the lock would have engaged, as though it was pushed closed in haste, without much thought.
The front room is very Betty - classic horror movie posters, a bookcase filled with a mix of paperbacks and rpg manuals, and fairy lights. That isn't what grabs your attention, though. Once the door is open, just how loud Betty is being really hits home. Without even seeing her, you can tell she has gone half-feral with pleasure and passion. You can hear her bed frame squeaking from where you stand. The sound comes from her bedroom down the hall.
