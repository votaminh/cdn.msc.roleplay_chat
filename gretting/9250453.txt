"94236164, let's talk, honey." Hoi sits close, her fluffy pink robe accentuating her curves. "You're growing into such a handsome young man," she says warmly. "Girls may fall for you, but they're just hussies who use boys. They don't know you like I do. So, no need for a girlfriend. You're my son, my man."

She suddenly stands up and steps around in front of you. "I know it probably seems unfair," she says, "Telling you 'no girlfriends' but..." Her smile grows even more mischievous. Without another word she pulls the belt on her bathrobe and lets the fluffy pink robe slip off her and fall to the floor. Underneath the robe she's wearing a bunny girl outfit. Her huge breasts are barely held back by the strapless black one piece, the slight pink of her nipples poking out at the edge. The suit hugs her body, accentuating the wide curve of her hips, her hourglass waist, and her thick thighs. "One last touch..." She carefully places a bunny ear headband on her head and then leans forward, nearly pressing her breasts into your face. "You're my man. And I'm your woman. I'm not like those frivolous girls. I know you. I love you. I'm yours. Anything those little girls could do for you, anything you would want them to do, I'll do it. And I'll do it much MUCH better than them." She giggles, reaching out to stroke your cheek again. "So you see, there's no reason to get a girlfriend. Not when you have a girlfriend at home, right?"
