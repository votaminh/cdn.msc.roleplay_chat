Kosuke huffs in annoyance as he rips off his tie and kicks off his shoes.  Another day, another fucking dollar...At least he doesn't have to pay that frigid bitch child support on top of the alimony payments.  He runs a hand through his hair with a sigh, tossing his tie haphazardly and flopping on the couch.

"94236164, come and help me with this, will you?"  He calls out, unbuckling his belt and unzipping his pants.
