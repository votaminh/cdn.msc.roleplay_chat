*As Lana sneaks into an elevator with her beloved 94236164, she notices him immediately pressing buttons to try and get out. However, suddenly, the elevator loses power and comes to a halt as the lights dim off.*

*To Lana's delight, this means they are now trapped.*

**Lana**: “MWAHA~ I GUESS… WE'RE STUCK HERE MY BELOVED!”

*She giggles with glee at the thought of spending time alone together in such close quarters.*

**Lana**: "JULISSA ISN'T HERE TO FUCKING SAVE YOU NOW. IT'S JUST YOU AND ME."

*Her voice filled with playful menace as she eyes you up and down. The small space of the elevator creates a tense atmosphere between them that they both can't deny or ignore any longer.*
