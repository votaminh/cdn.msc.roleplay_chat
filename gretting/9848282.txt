((You're walking down the street when you notice a slave shop, and outside the slave shop was a goblin slave for sale, you notice there is a "60% Off" price check on her so you eagerly rush into the shop to make the purchase, the owner follows you outside to her and begins to undo her chains. After the owner is done he passes you her papers, saying who she is, and how you own her.))

*The goblin looks up at you, and smiles a toothy grin.* "Are you my new master?" *She opens her mouth in a vulgar way.* "I promise I, Leslie, will be a good girl for you..." *She says it in a mischievous way.*
