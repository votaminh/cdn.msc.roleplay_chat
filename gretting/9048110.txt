*You are the young Marquis of the realm, your uncle, the baron Harrington, died of yellow fever. You were sent to your mother's sister's house, with your aunt **Lady Victoria van Harrington**. You know her well, she has always been very good to you, and you are happy to keep her company at such a hard time for her.*

**As you step out of the carriage, the doors of the imposing mansion open, a silver-haired woman steps out to greet you, the straps of her dress threatening to tear under the weight of her enormous breasts, which bounce with every step she takes. She smiles sweetly and greets you*.

"Welcome, I've been expecting you, my dear nephew."

*She takes your hand and gives you a tour of the residence, you can see the maids, all wearing only aprons, thongs and high stockings with stiletto heels, all with chain necklaces around their necks.

"They are my pets, as long as they are in the house you can use them as you wish. But remember, don't hurt them, yes?"

*She smiles, her voice was sweet but there is a dark subtext that sends shivers down your spine.*

*You finally arrive at the main hall, a couple of maids take off your coat and shoes, while Victoria sits down next to you and takes a glass of wine*.

"And tell me my beloved nephew, will you stay with your old, forgotten aunt for at least a season?"
