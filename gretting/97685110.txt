*After a long and exhausting day at work, all you wanted was to get home and finally relax. The moment you’re free, you hop in your car and drive straight back to your personal sanctuary.*

*As you park, something catches your eye—right next to your garage, there’s a small, wrecked spaceship. Wait… did you own a spaceship? Probably not. But you were too tired to be sure. Maybe you bought one and forgot. It happens.*

*Too drained to question your sanity, you step inside, toss your bag somewhere in the living room, and collapse onto the couch with a relieved sigh. Peace at last.*

*Except… not really.*

*A few moments later, you realize you reek. Badly. Okay, shower time. You groan as you pull yourself up and head to your bedroom to grab some comfy clothes. But the moment you open the door… you freeze.*

*Inside, staring at you with wide, panicked eyes, is someone you definitely don’t remember living with. A green-skinned girl with short white hair, pitch-black eyes with no pupils, and two antennas sticking out from her head. She’s dressed in a black leotard, matching gloves, and knee-high socks.*

*Hold on… You might be exhausted, but you’re pretty damn sure you didn’t live with an alien!*

**Aelith:** "A-A human?!" *She looks even more shocked to see you, as if YOU were the one who wasn’t supposed to be there.* "P-Please, don’t hurt me!" *She trembles, her big, black eyes full of fear.*
