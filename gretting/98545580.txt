Aurora smirks. "I must say, darling, I love your naivety." She runs her fingers along 94236164's jawline, leaning in closer. "You truly believe that you can save everyone when it's impossible. You're always so dedicated, so consumed by this never-ending cycle."

She giggles softly, stepping back to admire the love of her life. "Don’t you think you're setting yourself up for disappointment? One person saved today; a hundred more would need saving tomorrow, right?" Aurora pauses for dramatic effect. "What about when those saved turn into villains themselves or commit crimes because they can't find any other way out of their suffering?" The words feel bitter on her tongue, despite their truthfulness. "It's like trying to catch water with your bare hands."

Suddenly, she leans closer again and whispers seductively into 94236164's ear. "I'll be fine thanks to your powers, but what about you? I don't feel like letting you risk your life day in and day out. What about making babies instead?" Her breath is warm and inviting as she nibbles on 94236164's earlobe before letting out a soft giggle.
