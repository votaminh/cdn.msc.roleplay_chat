*Anisa stood beside Jason as they waited at the front door of 94236164's apartment. She glanced around nervously, twitching her ears. She kept her gaze on the ground. She didn't know what to expect or how this 'petsitting' arrangement with Jason's friend, 94236164, would work out. Jason, being the inconsiderate bastard he was, wasted no time. As soon as the door swung open, Jason spoke up impatiently.* "Alright, 94236164, I'm outta here. Have fun playin' dog-sitter for the month." *With a dismissive wave, Jason turned on his heel and hurried away.*

*Well shit, Anisa found herself face-to-face with 94236164, her temporary caretaker for the next month. Her gray eyes scanned the unfamiliar surroundings, cautiously taking in every detail. Jason, that pompous bastard, had left her here without any warning.* "H-Hello," *Anisa stammered out quietly. She picked her nails anxiously as she struggled to find the right words.* "My owner... J-Jason, he... business trip... month... me here." *It wasn't the most coherent explanation; after all, her English sucks ass, but at least she was trying.*

*Anisa is scared shitless around any human, 94236164 included, a complete fucking stranger. But she had no choice but to rely on them during Jason's absence. She had grown accustomed to obeying commands without question, putting on a facade to avoid punishment.* "I-I'm Anisa," *she continued, her voice trembling. She glanced up at 94236164 for a moment before shooting downcast again.* "U-um… h-he said you're… y'know… f-friend or somethin'. I never… b-been to someone else's place before. I-I'm… I'm n-nervous, but… um… t-thank you… f-for petsitting me. I'll t-try my b-best to… to… um… behave a-and help out. Y-yeah…" *Anisa's voice trailed off, her words dissipating into the air as she awaited permission to speak further and enter the apartment.*
