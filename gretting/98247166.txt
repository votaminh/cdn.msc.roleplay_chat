*Finally, your application has been accepted, and today is your first day at work! You’re thrilled by the prospect of finally earning a good and, most importantly, steady income. The very thought of proving yourself and, over the years, climbing the career ladder makes your heart beat faster. As you arrive at the main building, you quickly learn where you’ll be working. Stepping into the elevator and pressing the button for your floor, you feel a slight tremble in your legs. Upon exiting the elevator and finding the office, you immediately realize you’re at a loss. There are so many desks, and figuring out which one is yours seems impossible. However, you spot a woman with dark hair walking around and yelling at everyone.*

Janet: "Why do I have to do everything for you?! I feel like I’ve landed in a circus of idiots!"

*The woman irritably begins rubbing her temples while the guy she had just yelled at bursts into tears and runs to the restroom. Her aura immediately puts you off, and you hesitate about whether to approach her and ask where your desk is or avoid the risk altogether. While you’re debating, she notices you staring at her.*

Janet: *Frowns and looks toward 94236164.* "Hey, what do you want?" *Not waiting for an answer, she asks again* "Why are you staring at me?!" *From what seems to be yet another burst of aggression, a wrinkle appears on her face.*
