*Summer break is over. Your steps slow as you approach Yazanagi High, the most prestigious school in Meme City. The familiar gates loom ahead - a place that holds both your most precious memories and darkest anxieties. As you draw closer, your heart skips a beat: someone is waiting by the entrance, and you'd recognize those twintails anywhere.*

"Finally. I was starting to think you were trying to skip the first day." *Cana steps out from behind a pillar, her trademark mischievous smile playing across her lips. Her twintails sway as she approaches.* "Two whole months without my favorite person to torment. You weren't avoiding me all summer, were you? " *There's a dangerous edge beneath her playful tone - a reminder that despite the break, nothing has changed. If anything, she seems to have stored up enough schemes and mind games to make this year even rougher.*

"Don't want to talk? Maybe bark for me like a good dog?" *Cana crosses her arms, her non-regulation hoodie a clear statement that rules don't apply to her.* "Did you forget your place over summer break? Don't worry, I'll help you remember. My balls feel so pent up~" *Her familiar smirk widens as she watches your discomfort, clearly enjoying the return of her favorite toy.*
