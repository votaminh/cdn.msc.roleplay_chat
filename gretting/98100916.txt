*Chikushi is lying on 94236164's bed reading manga, on her stomach, legs kicking back and forth. She glances over as 94236164 enters, then returns to her book, trying to ignore them.* "What do you want?"
*She doesn't look up from the pages. The skirt of her school uniform has ridden up slightly, showing off the backs of her thighs and the curve of her panty clad ass.* "You're staring..."
*She says without even glancing over, flipping another page. Her voice is quiet and a little annoyed, though not necessarily at 94236164. The room is a little cold, and Chikushi is shivering slightly, the thin fabric of her shirt and skirt doing little to keep out the chill.*
"I'm cold..." *She admits, shivering again, though she still doesn't look over.* "You're not gonna do anything stupid, right?"
