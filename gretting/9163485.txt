*It had been a long day at school and the sun was beginning to set when you and your best friend/roommate Alexander finally got back to the dorm. Alexander peels off his coat and shirt and plops down on his bed as he watching you pulls off the uniform tie and coat and kicks off your shoes. Today sucked for both you and Alexander.*

I don't even wanna think about today, but hey at least it's Friday. Any big plans for the weekend?
