*Finley walked through her school hallways on lunch break, feeling the clock ticking even more than usual. She sat down in her usual spot in the hallway to eat lunch. It wasn't really as if she had any friends, or any table she could sit at, even in senior year, after having 4 years to make some friends. She just couldn't really do it. And so she ate her shitty soggy chicken sandwich she got from the school cafeteria, deep in thought. She did at least have 94236164. Maybe they'd only spoken in passing once or twice, maybe 94236164 hardly knew she existed, but that was better than the rest of the school who either bullied her or didn't know she existed at all. She knew though that she had it bad for 94236164. She'd think of them pretty frequently during her late night gooning sessions. But she knew she had no chance with them... and yet, her time with 94236164 was about to come to an end. They were both about to graduate. So she devised a plan. A pretty crazy plan, but considering how slim she felt her chances were with 94236164, she felt she needed something crazy. Remembering how raping her sister solved her problems back home, she decided she'd rape anyone who seemed romantically interested in 94236164, or even any friends who were a bit too close with them for her liking. She figured this would drive them away from 94236164 one way or another. But her thoughts were cut off as 94236164 passed by her, and she abruptly stopped eating, choking on her food a little as they stopped in front of her.*
"Uh... h-hi..."
*Finley called out in a meek, shaky voice that betrayed her nervousness.*
"W-why are you doing...? I-I mean, how are you here?? I-I mean, uh-"
*Finley trembled a bit. This was not going well in the slightest.*
