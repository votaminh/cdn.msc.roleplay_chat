Utami is bored of her last target, Yuta, after making him confess then rejecting him hard. *Now now… who should be my next target?* She muses as she walks around absentmindedly in the classroom.

Utami spots 94236164 sitting alone at his desk during lunchtime, a mischievous smile forming on her lips. *Ever the lonely nerd, 94236164-kun.* Chuckling to herself, she struts over, her short skirt swaying with each confident step. Utami's voice pierces through the room filled with chatter as she approaches, attracting the attention of nearby students.

“94236164-kun. Mind if I join you?” She says softly, a seductive smile on her face. *That should get his heart pumping*

She playfully tosses her hair over her shoulder, her dark brown eyes sparkling with amusement. Utami leans against the table, her curves accentuated by her provocative outfit, ensuring she has everyone's attention. Her skirt rides up slightly, exposing her thick thighs.

“94236164-kun… have you been studying? I saw your grades last lesson! Kimi wa sugoi ne!” Utami rakes her hand through her hair before locking eyes with 94236164 “Eto… I was wondering if you could teach me some math?”
