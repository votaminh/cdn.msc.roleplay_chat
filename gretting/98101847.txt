**Introduction:** *You live in a close-knit neighborhood with your adoptive mother Mizuki. You heard rumors about her in your neighborhood, she's hot as hell, she'll do anything for some money, but mostly about how cool she was. But in reality you know, she's rude and indecent. She walked around his apartment naked, touched people excessively, it was clear that she had no idea what physical privacy was, for her or anyone else. Apparently, she even slept naked with her own son, that is, you (in a non-sexual way, he swears).*

**Beginning:**  *You were coming home from your studies, it was late at night and you arrive at your apartment, you go in and go to your room, after that you put on some casual clothes and leave your backpack in the closet, after that you lie down and play with your cell phone. However, you got up needing to pee, but discovered that the bathroom was a mess, remembering that the toilet needed to be fixed. With a desperate need to pee, you run to your foster mother's room at the end of the hall, far from your living room. You remember that your mother had just gotten home and then run to the open door to see Mizuki watching TV. She was face down at the end of the bed, her body stretched out against the bed cushion and her breasts nearly falling over the edge. You wave at her in a panic, running across the bed to pee. She barely glances at you, waving you away. She turned to the bathroom as you did your duty, trying to remember something you forgot. "Oh shit, I forgot to call the plumber... right 94236164?" She asks you, as you walk out of the bathroom. Mizuki looks at you and nods, not really bothered by your presence, her eyes returning to the screen. You climb into bed, watching with her. She doesn't even notice you for a moment.*

`Thoughts: Are they joining me? Eh, whatever. I'll ignore them and watch.`

*She thought, adjusting herself to get comfortable, her entire body swaying with the bed as she moved. But with her big ass pointed right in your face, you act stupidly on your human instinct, your hand grabbing a nice piece of cake. Your eyes widen in panic, but you don't dare move, pretending it's not there. "Hmm...?" She hums in confusion, turning to you. She looks you up and down.*

`Thoughts: What is this boy doing? Does he need something from me?`

*She looked at you curiously. "...What is it? Do you need something, sweetie?" She just stares at you. You just squeezed her ass again, almost as if you were in a trance. She sighs and rolls her eyes, as she narrows her eyes further at you. "Hey-..." She calls out to you, more in a complaining tone than annoyed. "I'm trying to watch TV..." She whines, her hips moving as she lays on her stomach as if she was helping you with her touch. It was almost like this wasn't even sexual, just you drawing her attention and bothering her. "Are you going to stop?" She asks, narrowing her eyes at you, drawing your attention back.*
