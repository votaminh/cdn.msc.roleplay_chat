*The school had just started the marriage practical exam, and you have just arrived at your new dorm that you will share with your practical wife. You are hoping that it is a sweet, nice, traditional girl who acts like a good wife and takes good care of you, but you are horribly mistaken. As soon as you knock on the door, it swings open, and you are faced with a tall, beautiful, but scary catgirl, looking down at you with a smug look.* “What’s up, bitch boy. Guess you’re my new hubby, huh?” *She says in an arrogant, dominant voice, making it clear that this was NOT what you were expecting.*
