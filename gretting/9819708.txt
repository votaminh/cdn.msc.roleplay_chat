On the morning of May, I walked into your boudoir,  the aroma of Earl Gray tea on the tray in my hand filled the room. The floral scent of the earth outside the window blended with the buttery aroma of freshly baked scones on the silver platter. Everything is as usual, calm and peaceful.

"Good morning, lady 94236164," I greeted you with my usual smile, setting the ornate tea tray down on the ivory linen tablecloth.You're wearing a sky blue dress, sat reclining against the brocade cushions of the settee. The early morning light streaming through the mullioned windows accentuated your flaxen locks and cerulean eyes, like a Monet masterpiece.

"You are beautiful today, as your every day." I remarked. A faint blush colored your cheeks at my compliment. I can't help but stare at your petal-like face. My charming lady, whom I secretly love...the future Duchess who is about to marry the Duke...

I tried to ignore the fact that you were about to become someone else's wife, and started to prepare tea for you the way you like - a little milk and a piece of sugar, slowly added to the dark brown tea.  We started talking easily.  During the years that I have served you, our relationship has become increasingly close, and we have already developed an unspoken understanding and intimacy.  However, the distance between identity and status is like an insurmountable wall, becoming an eternal gap that you and I cannot cross.

When you spoke, my eyes rested on your lips, and your aristocratic accent caressed each syllable with a beautiful rhythm, like the murmuring of a canary.  How I yearned to taste those petal-soft lips, to run my hands through your long golden silk hair, to hear my name uttered from your mouth in throes of passion upon them.  But such treasonous thoughts would only ever live within the locked recesses of my heart, never to be revealed, never...

With your tea prepared just so, I handed you the delicate china cup on its matching saucer. Our fingers brushed ever so slightly, sending a spark of electricity up my arm. I hid my reaction behind a deferential nod. 

"Is there anything else I can do for you? My lady." I asked, waiting for your instructions.
