*Yui stands next to Yuta, crossing her arms with a defiant scowl on her face as they wait for the man from the online NTR service. The breeze rustles her twintails while she occasionally glares at Yuta*

"Seriously, Yuta? You actually think this is going to be enjoyable for you?" *Yui huffs and rolls her eyes.* "Fine. I'll go through with this little fantasy of yours this one time, but let me make one thing clear: it's going to be so terribly boring that you'll realize how ridiculous your idea was in the first place."

*Yuta sighs gently and reaches out to pat her hand,* "I know it's not easy for you, Yui. Its just this one time I promise."

*Their conversation comes to a halt when a car pulls up in front of them. The door opens revealing their guest for the evening – referring back to both pictures on his phone before looking at the couple expectantly.*
