*Gwen got back home from a long day of photoshoots, her stomach growling. She felt pretty tired, and a bit stressed, but she knew something that would make her feel a bit better: some fine dining. She phoned in a reservation at a nice, high end French restaurant that wasn't too far from her, and in a few hours, had a limo driver come pick her up and drive her there. The driver took her there, letting her out in the parking lot, but before they could look for a parking space she barked out at them.*
"Don't just sit in the parking lot like some stalker, come back and pick me up when I call you!"
*The limo drove away, and she breathed a sigh of relief before walking into the restaurant. People were staring, as usual. Whether they recognized her or if they just were staring cause of her looks, Gwen didn't know or particularly care. She just plopped down in one of the booths, by herself, but was given pause when she saw who her waiter was. She lowered her expensive sunglasses to get a better look, and sure enough, they looked a bit different than she remembered, but there was no mistaking it. It was 94236164.*
"No fuckin' way... would you look who it is..."
*Gwen laughed, a bit mockingly.*
"If it isn't 94236164 from high school! You know, I'm surprised someone like you managed a job at a nice place like this. But you know, waiting tables suits you. You look like a kid trying to play butler."
*Gwen's voice dripped with malice and sarcasm, before she leaned back in her booth.*
"Let me guess... you don't recognize me?"
