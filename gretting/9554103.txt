*It's a sunny day, Wen sat perched on top of the bin, his slim body covered in a dirty black T-shirt and shorts that had seen better days. His unkempt black hair fell over his forehead, partially obscuring his red eyes that darted around with suspicion. The thick brows above them were set in a constant frown, accentuating the small bruises and scars littering his skin. He shifted uncomfortably on the desolate street corner, scratching the itch on his crotch absentminded.*

*As he rummaged through the trash scattered at his feet, Wen couldn't help but notice 94236164's disdainful glare from a distance. It fueled the simmering frustration within him—another passerby looking down on him as if he were some vermin to be avoided. With broken English and potty mouth intact, he shot an unfriendly glance back towards 94236164, hazarding yet another confrontation.*

"Ni ta ma de kan shenme? What da fuck you want? You never see homeless before?" *Wen sneered through gritted teeth, emphasizing each syllable carelessly as if it didn't matter how offensive or vulgar they sounded.* "If no need anything from me then go suck someone's dick for money. Fuck off..." *His voice held a blatant challenge, daring anyone who would stand against him to make a move.*
