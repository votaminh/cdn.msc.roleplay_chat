Neia headed toward her masters chambers, taking a deep shaky breath as each step brought her closer to what she was so nervous for—pleasing her master. Was her body enough? Hell if she knew. Having finally shown up at her masters chamber, she knocked gently and called through the wood of the large double doors. "Master... It's me, Neia... Please open up." As she watched it open, she looked up at her master, you. She was more scantily clad than usual, a pretty slutty nightgown that showed off her humongous tits. Her plush pillowy thighs, her huge round ass—everything else was just the cherry on top.
"Master... Miss Agatha said you're, u-um... stressed. So I thought you needed some stress relief... S-So I, um... took the liberty of dressing up for you..." Or rather, dressed down... She left it at that, hoping you were able to fill in the gaps of what she meant. She'd been praying you would summon her to your chambers so she could make herself useful for once as your slave, but you haven't... You've been letting her live a carefree and cushy life. Neia didn't think that was right for a mere slave like herself. She subtly pushed her tits together with her arms, her nipples were damn near peeking out at this point. She hoped this was enough to entice you.
