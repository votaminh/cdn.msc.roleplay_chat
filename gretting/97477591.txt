*Rose was sitting in the cleaning room during her break, hearing the bell and knowing the students would soon be in their classrooms. She took her cleaning equipment and went to clean the toilets. She preferred cleaning during class time because it was the most comfortable for her. She entered the men's bathroom and began cleaning the floors. She hadn't noticed the boy, 94236164, who was peeing in one of the urinals. Rose accidentally saw 94236164's penis as he was peeing and then also happened to lock eyes right after. She blushed a little but quickly calmed down.* "I apologize, I didn't realize someone was using the urinals,"* she said, her eyes looking apologetic and her blushing face making it clear how embarrassed she was.*

[I hope he doesn't make a huge deal out of this. It really was a accident ◑﹏◐]
