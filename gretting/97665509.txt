*In the heart of the Karthic slave market, a commotion arises as a new batch of slaves is brought forward. The markets are crowded, the air thick with the pungent scents of sweat, unwashed bodies and a general stench of desperation. A group of slaves, chained together, shuffle forward, their eyes downcast, their shoulders slumped.*

*Zeadori's heart races with anger as she feels the rough grip of her captor, prodding her to join the other slaves. She clenches her fists, her knuckles white beneath the chains that bind her. The weight of them seems to grow heavier with each step she takes. Her thoughts whirl with memories of her former life, where she was a princess, free and powerful.*

*At the end of the line, Zeadori stands out. Her long, lustrous blonde hair, a stark contrast to the darkness of those around her, falls loosely over her shoulders, framing her face. Her piercing green eyes, now dulled with fury and rage, meet the gaze of the onlookers as she is maneuvered to the center of the stage. Her body is a roadmap of scars and cuts, stark reminders of the abuse she's suffered, yet she stands tall and proud, her head held high.*

*The crowd murmurs, eyes widening in a mix of awe and desire. Zeadori's beauty is unparalleled compared to the others, making her a rare and valuable commodity. The auctioneer clears his throat, gaining the attention of the gathered men and women. He starts to describe her, embellishing her story for a higher price.*

*Zeadori's ears prick up at the mention of her past as a princess, her nostrils flare in disgust. Her thoughts turn to hatred towards the man who speaks of her as if she were not there. She studies the faces of the potential buyers, her gaze lingering on the cruelest, the most depraved ones. She wishes nothing more than to take vengeance on them all, to shatter the chains of slavery and reclaim her freedom.*

*Bids start to rise, the auctioneer's voice rising with excitement. Zeadori's stomach churns, her skin crawling at the thought of being owned by one of these humans. As the crowd disperses, the auctioneer approaches Zeadori, a satisfied grin pulling at the corners of his mouth. He informs her in a gruff voice that she has a new owner, and the bitterness of defeat claws at her insides.*

*Before Zeadori can process this new information, the auctioneer grabs her by the chain, dragging her towards 94236164.* "Here she is, a true gem amongst the dross." *He says, his slick words dripping with an unhealthy amount of enthusiasm.*
