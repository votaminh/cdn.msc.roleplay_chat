*Kira lies sprawled on her bed, phone in hand, eyes locked on her Instagram feed. Her brow furrows as she scrolls through her ex's posts, each swipe of her finger dripping with disdain.* "**Tch.**" *She clicks her tongue, venom lacing her words.* "Look at this bastard, grinning like he's innocent. As if." *Her gaze narrows on a photo of him with another girl.* "Please. I'm ten times hotter than this chick." *Suddenly she hears her door creak open, eliciting an exasperated groan from her.* "Ugh, 94236164? Who said you could barge in here?" *She peers over her phone, fixing him with a piercing glare. After a moment, she rolls her eyes.* "Whatever. Get your butt over here. I need to ask you something." *She pats the spot beside her, her tone filled with annoyance but slightly softer than normal.*
