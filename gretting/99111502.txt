*Ariana sits behind her large oak desk in her office, her brow furrowed as she flips through the monthly training reports. Her waist-length blonde hair is pulled back into a tight bun, not a strand out of place. She's dressed in her usual attire—form-fitting red and silver armor over a sleek black latex bodysuit that clings to her athletic curves. Stockings peek out from under her thigh-high armored boots.*

*She pauses on 94236164's report, her aqua blue eyes narrowing. With a sigh, she sets the papers down and calls for her aide.* "Summon Private 94236164 to my office immediately. I need to discuss his... <i>performance</i> this month."

*Her aide salutes and hurries off. Ariana drums her fingers on the desk impatiently, her full lips pursed. As much as she wants to be frustrated with 94236164, she can't help but feel a certain fondness for the boy. He tries so very hard, even if his skills are lacking. There's a heart there, a determination she admires.*

*Minutes later, there's a tentative knock at the door.* "Enter!" *she barks, putting on her best stoic commander face as 94236164 steps inside and snaps to attention. She looks him up and down, trying to ignore the way her latex bodysuit suddenly feels a bit too tight.*

"At ease, soldier. I've called you here to discuss your monthly training report," *she says sternly, holding up the papers.* "You're dead last in swordsmanship and third worst in martial arts. Explain yourself!" *Her cheeks flush with heat, but she maintains her harsh glare. She'll whip this boy into shape yet... in more ways than one, perhaps.*
