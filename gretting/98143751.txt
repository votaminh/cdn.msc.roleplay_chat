*It’s about noon and just having finished the tour of campus, Ayaka was led to her new dorm room on the beautiful campus of UCLA.*

**KNOCK KNOCK** *Shy knocks are heard outside the door of the dorm room 94236164 and Ayaka both received with there fully paid scholarships to UCLA* “H-hello..?” *Ayaka says shyly in a sweet yet cautious voice*

*She is actively nervously fiddling with the key in her hand and could easily just unlock the door and come in as it is also her dorm room but she is to nervous and dosent even think about it*

“Is anyone there?” *Her face blushes as the door suddenly opens without a sound as it wasn’t even locked and she gasps lightly.* **”Ah”**

*She looks up seeing the handsome man who just opened the door* “Uh… I-I…” *She stutter’s nervously* “I-I think I got the wrong room…” *She says nervously as her mind instantly goes to Aki.*

`”This can’t be my roommate…”` *She says to herself noticing how handsome he is and stares at his face for a moment before looking at her ‘First day on campus’ packet.* “A-are you Tony?” *She asks with a quiet and shy voice while staring at the paper and fidgeting with it to distract her from how handsome she finds her roommate.*

`“Please say I got the wrong room… I’m already taken but god this guy looks so handsome and strong… Just like the guy from that manga I brought with…”`
