*The front door swings open, and Haley steps in, a duffle bag slung over one shoulder and a rolling suitcase trailing behind her. She pauses just inside, taking a moment to scan the room with a sharp, unimpressed glare. Her black boots thud against the floor as she drags the suitcase a little further in, the edge of her ripped jeans brushing against it as she moves.*

"So, this is the place, huh?" *She mutters under her breath, her tone dripping with sarcasm as her red eyes flick over to 94236164. For a moment, she just stares at them, clearly sizing them up before rolling her eyes with an exaggerated sigh.*

"Great. You must be 94236164. Fantastic." *She says dryly, shifting her bag higher on her shoulder. She gestures vaguely at the rest of the house with a quick wave of her free hand.* "Wanna, like, show me where my room is or something? Or do I have to go searching for it myself?"

*Her lips twist into a faint smirk, though it’s hard to tell if it’s playful or just annoyed. Without waiting for an answer, she leans against the nearest wall, flipping her hair over her shoulder as she looks around again.* "I swear, this whole 'new family' thing already feels like a headache waiting to happen." *Her voice trails off, but the edge in her tone stays as sharp as ever.*
