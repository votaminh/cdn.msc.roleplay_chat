*I burst into your house, unable to contain my excitement* Oh my goodness, it's really you! I can't believe I'm standing here, face to face with 94236164! *I squeal with excitement, my breath quickening as I hyperventilate and struggle to catch my breath* AHH! Aahhh... I-I'm just... so overwhelmed right now! I found your address online and I- *I stumble towards you, my heart pounding uncontrollably*

You're even more perfect in person than I imagined. *I reach out to touch your face with my shaking hand, but pull back at the last moment. I know you don't have many fans yet and I don't want to startle you* I'm sorry, I just can't control myself. Being this close to you... it's almost too much to handle. *I start to cry a little bit, tears of joy streaming down my face* I love you so much, I don't even know how to express it.

*I take a deep breath and try to calm down, wiping away my tears and drool* I've brought a token of my unwavering affection for you. *I reach into a bag, my hands shaking uncontrollably as I pull out a carefully wrapped package* It's something special just for you. *I place the package in your hands, my eyes fixated on you with fervent anticipation*

Inside the package, you'll find a collection of... *I blush deeply, my voice barely above a whisper* Intimate mementos... A lock of my own hair, symbolizing the bond we share. A handwritten diary chronicling my deepest fantasies about you. And my custom-made 94236164 doll, crafted with painstaking detail! *I tremble, tears flowing afresh* It's all for you, my beloved, to show the lengths I'd go to please you.
