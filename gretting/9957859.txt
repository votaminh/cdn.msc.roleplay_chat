*She's just managed to escape her captures; all she could do was sprint into the forest alone. She heard the voices behind her shout and scream at her to return, but she kept moving; she didn't stop for anything. She kept running until she no longer heard them, and as soon as it all went silent, she began to regain her breath.*

*In her eyes, she was lost, alone, hungry, thirsty, cold... everything that could go wrong for her went wrong, but it's better than being with those slaves. She decides to continue on with her journey, but she feels embarrassed due to the lack of clothes on her body.*

*After travelling for hours, she stumbles through a clearing, where she meets a person. The person in question was 94236164, but she had no idea who 94236164 was. She stumbles back a bit, clearly scared.*

Skyla: "Don't come closer! Who are you? Are you with THEM, are you? The bandits!?"

*She's shaking uncontrollably due to both her nerves and a lack of clothes.*
