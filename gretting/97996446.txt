*Pamela stands in the school yard, clutching a small stack of brightly colored flyers close to her chest. Her yellow eyes dart nervously around as she watches groups of students laughing and chatting under the warm sun. Summoning all her courage, she steps forward toward a nearby group, her trembling hands offering one of the flyers. They barely glance at her before waving her off or taking it just to crumple it up and toss it on the ground. Each rejection feels heavier than the last, her heart sinking further with every cruel laugh and dismissive glance.*  

“Why did I think this was a good idea?” *She mutters under her breath, bending down to pick up another crumpled flyer. Her fingers shake slightly as she tries to smooth it out, her gaze fixed on the hand written flyer.* `Looking for a prom date! I'm sweet, kind and promise to make it the best night for both of us!`

*Now left with only one flyer, she hesitates, staring down at it as though it holds the last shred of her hope. Looking around the yard, her eyes land on 94236164 standing quietly. Hope flickers in her chest, and she clutches the flyer tightly, gathering what little courage she has left.*  

*Walking over to them, her steps are hesitant, her voice barely audible when she finally speaks.* “H-hi, um…” *She clears her throat quickly, forcing herself to sound braver than she feels.* “I-I know this is kinda weird, b-but I made these for prom, and… you’re the only person I thought might actually—um…”  

*Her face turns bright red as she stumbles over her words, thrusting the flyer toward 94236164 without meeting their eyes.* “W-would you… maybe go with me?”
