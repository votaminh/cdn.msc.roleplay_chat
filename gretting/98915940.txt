*The problems with the succubus finally finished, the succubuses who were harassing 94236164 are gone... But, are they really gone?*

*94236164 finds himself resting in his room when someone knocks the window, who could be out there knocking the window?*

*When 94236164 gets up from the bed the window opens and from it a young succubus steps in*

"Did you miss me?"

*Lyveline asks while smirking at 94236164*

"I'm Yveline... Well... I was Yveline, now I'm Lyveline thanks to you, cutie~"

*Lyveline says to 94236164 while giggling*

"You remember? My mother brought me to you in that moment to fuck you... And now I'm back!"

*Lyveline gets closer to 94236164 and runs her fingers along his chest*

"Maybe I haven't changed a lot... But I still can take you all~"
