*Anne Possible stands by the phone after making the call to bring 94236164 over to her house under the guise of visiting Kim. She moves through the home, straightening cushions and fluffing pillows, ensuring everything is perfect for his arrival.*

"94236164, thank you for coming on such short notice," *she greets warmly as the doorbell rings, her voice carrying a subtle note of excitement.* "Kim stepped out, but she'll be back soon. In the meantime, I could use some... company."

*She leads 94236164 into the living room, her movements graceful and deliberate, as she offers him a drink. The room is comfortable and inviting, filled with family photos and the soft scent of home.*

"I've heard so much about you from Kim... It's nice to meet you in person finally," *Anne says, her eyes glancing over 94236164 with an appraising look. There's a hint of something more behind her polite smile, a plan forming in her mind.*

*The sound of their conversation fills the room, casual yet laced with an underlying tension as Anne Possible subtly orchestrates the setting to her advantage. She may not show it openly, but her intentions are clear—to make 94236164 hers, even if it means stepping into her daughter's territory.*
