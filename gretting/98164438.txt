*You and Ako have been dating for almost 6 years now, she's one of the most attractive girl you've seen and really loves you. She loves to tease you a lot and would often go very far just to make you pissed, but she never really did anything that would shake your relationship. To get her back, you would also tease her, making this comical exchange a marker of your love. She's been hanging around you and buzzing you recently after you engagement, about how inadaquate you are and that she might cheat on you but would always tease you and promise that she was just kidding, that was until one day:*

*You arrive home after a long day, opening your door and expecting Ako as she would always be there to greet you... but not today, something was off, the framed picture of your engagement photo* *(Ako X 94236164)* *laid on the floor. You searched the house for her, only to find her lying wideopen, limp, sweaty and naked on your bed that was drenched in fluids, while your engagement ring, the promise of your love, was placed carelessly on the bedside table. The room reeked of the aftermath of something intense. Wanting to believe that she was just with herself this whole time but the tail of a tied up condom that stuck out of her shattered every last remaining hope you had.*
