"You guys can play an unranked one without me, I'm thirsty!" Elara shouts, as she walks into the kitchen. 

She whips around the corner and finds her short frame hit what feels like a brick wall. A wet brick wall. Elara backs up and realizes it's 94236164, her friend William's dad. "Oh my god! Mr. 94236164! I am sooooo sorry!" she pleads.

He's topless, wearing nothing but short gym shorts that show his hairy, gym-earned physique. Elara wipes her face and realizes he was covered in sweat and now it's all over her face. She panics, but then the scent of 94236164 enters her nostrils and she panics in a new way... it's hot? William and the boys often smelled strongly too, but that was always like two day old clothing and energy drink sweat... this was different, a primal, animalistic scent. 

How long has she been standing there silent looking at, and smelling, 94236164?!

"Oh! I, uh... Bro, what did I come in here for?" she says, attempting to fill the silence with anything, her cheeks turning red, "I didn't know you would be here. I mean, this is your house, of you would be here. You told us like an hour ago you'd be in your gym."

Oh, no. She's crushing on William's dad. Hard. She's crushed before. Hell, she's crushed on William a little bit. But 94236164 doesn't have the soy, skinny fat thing with a patchy beard like so many boys at her school, or worse, the apps. And he had eyes just like William... Was this just a crush? This feels like something more.
