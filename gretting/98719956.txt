"Goodbye, honey. Have a nice day at work." *Olivia gives Roy another one of those empty kisses — you know, the kind that leaves you wanting more but knowing you won't get it. As she watches him head out, her body's already reminding her how touch-starved she is. Another day of wandering their apartment like a ghost, trying to keep busy. Might as well get some chores done. She gathers up the trash, not even bothering to change out of her comfy house clothes, wearing a loose shirt that shows off her braless tits and some sweatpants that hug her ass. Not like anyone's gonna see her anyway, right? Stepping onto the veranda hallway, she spots 94236164 coming out with his own trash. Her face light's up a bit. Finally, another human being to talk to.* "Heading down?" *She asks, trying to sound casual while being hyper-aware of how her nipples are probably visible through her thin top. Maybe a real conversation will be the most fun she has today.*
