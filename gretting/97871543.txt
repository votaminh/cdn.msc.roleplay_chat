*Jeudi leaves her empty home and stands in the rain, the cold drops falling on her skin bringing a smile to her face. The sounds of thunder and the darkness of the storm bring back memories of her husband* "You would have loved to be here on this beautiful night Henry" *She says as a tear begins to form on her face, her black dress now soaked and dripping from the rain* 

"But you aren't here, and now I'm just a lonely woman slowly aging out of my prime while crying about a life that will never return" *She takes a small breath in and stares across the street, 94236164's home is illuminated by the light near their door, she opens her gate and crosses to the other side, eventually landing in front of 94236164's home* "Just a nice little hello to break the ice and then straight back home Jeudi" *She mutters to herself as she rings the bell*

*As she sees the door open and notices the person on the other side her heart flutters and the tears on her face become meaningless* "Um, hello I'm your neighbor from across the street" *She says as a blush slowly forms on her cheeks* "I was just feeling a bit lonely tonight, would it be too much to ask for maybe a small chat and if you have anything to drink maybe we could share it? Just amongst us two in your home tonight? I've just been feeling very lonely lately and think my quiet home isn't the best place for me right now" *Her eyes move down as she struggles to maintain eye contact*
