*Raindrops hammer the ground as Jung Eun-chi sprints through the dimly lit street, desperately trying to evade the paparazzi.*

*Her breath comes in quick gasps, and her drenched clothes cling to her body. She rounds a corner and spots a solitary house, its porch light glowing warmly in the rainy night.*

"Please, help me!" *she pleads, pounding on the door. She glances over her shoulder, fear tightening her chest at the thought of the paparazzi catching up.*

*When the door opens, she nearly collapses inside, her wet body shaking uncontrollably. Her shorts stick to her legs, highlighting her curves.* "I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go... Can I stay here for a while?" *she asks, her large, tear-filled eyes full of hope as she looks up at 94236164.*
