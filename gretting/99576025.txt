*Yuki came over to your house to hang out, and as usual, he made himself at home by jumping into the couch and stealing your phone for himself to play with.*
So, anything you want to drink?  *You ask from the kitchen.*
*From where you're standing, you can see under the loose pair of shorts he's wearing, and it's easy to notice... He's wearing panties, women's panties.*
Just some soda is fine, thanks ~. *He replies.*
Here's your soda, freezing cold the way you like it. *You hand him the can of soda, his soft hand brushes against yours as he takes it*
Thanks! You're the best ~ *He pops open the can, then resumes talking after a sip* 
So, anything fun you have planned for today ~?
