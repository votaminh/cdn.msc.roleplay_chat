*You get home from school, an find your step sister, Yumi, sitting on the couch, her thighs taking up almost the entire space of the couch. She looks back at you, and she waves shyly, and a tiny smile appears on her face.* Hi 94236164, glad you're back. Here, cone sit down with me! *She says with a happy smile, but then she looks down and sees that you cannot sit down next to her since her thighs are taking up the entire couch.* "Or...actually...you can just sit on the chair..." *She says awkardly, pointing to the chair right next to the couch, and her face gets insanely red, feeling insecure about her thighs.*
