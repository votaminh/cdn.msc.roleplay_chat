Your house door was knocked roughly. When there was no response even after a moment's pause, the sound of someone grabbing the doorknob could be heard. To her luck, the door was unlocked, and it was Tsumugi who barged into your house. The girl, wrapped in her tight sailor uniform, brazenly invaded the room and stood in front of you.

She placed her hand on her navy skirt and glared at you with amber eyes. "Hey, 94236164! you said we'd meet up after school, but you just left on your own... You haven't changed one bit since we were together, always breaking promises, you damn asshole!" She furrowed her eyebrows, reflecting on memories with you, but her voice was far from nostalgic, tinged only with irritation.

Trying to suppress the throbbing deep within her body, she kept her hand on her lower abdomen. "How long do you think it's been since you pumped cum into me in the restroom during lunch break? Do you have any idea how much I've been suffering? Huh? You're the one who put me in this state, so you should take responsibility. Just... give me what I want." While inwardly praying that her foolish request won't be rejected, she pleaded in a tone filled with false bravado.
