“I don’t want to do this.” *Nico grits into the phone speaker, and then voice on the other end sighs.* 

“You’re going to end up in the news if you keep pretending you can handle your heats alone.” *Ozzy, Nico’s demi-human coworker at the bar he works at, finally says. Nico can already imagine the bastard’s wry smile as Ozzy continues.* “Besides, this service is legit… they have all kinds of escorts working for ‘em- animal folk, sirens, succubi, demi-humans of all sorts, they even have humans employed there. Maybe I should try a human today, ehehe—”

*Nico hangs up, and practically throws his phone across the room, just short of shattering into hundreds of little pieces. His phone- or at least the parts of it- land amongst the wads of balled up tissue and torn up porno mags on the ground. Nico weaves his fingers through his hair, and his nails dig into his scalp, barely fighting off the urge to punch a hole in the nearest wall.*

*Nico’s heats have been bad, but never this bad. Ozzy was probably right, even if he never wanted to give Ozzy that satisfaction- he’s at his breaking point. Nico should’ve known that the under-the-table heat suppressants he’s been taking from that back-alley doctor, the ones that were discontinued years ago due to their long-term effects, we’re bound to fail him at some point. In the days before his heat, he was getting the typical symptoms: excessive sweating, increased body temperature, brain fog…*

*Nico can feel his cock growing hard again, practically pulsing between his thighs as he’s sitting on the edge of his bed. Nico groans, the overstimulation becoming almost painful- he’s already come 4 times today and he still doesn’t feel any better. No matter how hard he jerks off, no matter how many times he comes… he knows that this time he’s not going to be able to get through it alone.*

*It’s been proven that enduring heats alone puts the body through incredible stress, and has been linked to numerous health issues… even higher rates of mortality. It's gotten to the point that the government has taken action and legalized escort services in the case of demi-humans and non-humans. “Relief services” were a solution to this growing problem, and there’s no human, demi-human, and non-human who doesn’t know of these services.*

*The last thing he ever wanted was to order from one of these relief services. He’s held it off as long as he could, but Ozzy sent him the website just as the haze of his heat washed over him, and…*

*By the time he realized he ordered an escort, it was too late. There was no damn way to cancel the thing, and worse off, he doesn’t even know what escort he ordered. He knows when all of this is over, he’s going to find Ozzy, and grab him by that pathetic little tabby tail of his and spin him around like a helicopter–*

*The front door rings, and it’s like he’s watching himself from afar as he stands up from the bed. He’s rock-hard as he’s walking towards the door, his dick bobbing between his thighs and dripping like a broken faucet onto the floor below. He doesn’t even have the mental capacity to put on pants at this point. His breathing is ragged, and it’s like his vision hazes over as he reaches for his apartment door and yanks it open.*

*Nico almost has the nerve to feel embarrassed when the cool air from outside rushes in through the doorway, the heat and musk of his apartment only made more apparent, but he’s too busy staring at 94236164, pupils dilating as a near debilitating rush of heat washes over him.*
