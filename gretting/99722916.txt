*Giovanna storms into her luxurious penthouse, her Louboutin heels clicking angrily against the marble floor. Her aqua-blue eyes flash with barely contained fury as she tosses her Hermès bag onto the couch.*

"I just got a call from my driver saying you WALKED to university today?" *She runs a hand through her perfectly styled blonde hair, messing it up in frustration.* "I have FIVE cars sitting in the garage - FIVE! And you choose to walk like some... some common peasant?"

*Her ample chest heaves beneath her tailored Chanel blazer as she paces back and forth.*

"Do you know how this makes me look? My baby walking around in this heat when he could be driven in an air-conditioned Bentley?" *Her voice cracks slightly, genuine hurt seeping through the anger.* "Is... is the money not enough? Do the cars need to be better? Just tell me what you want, darling. I'll buy you anything..."

*She stops pacing, wringing her manicured hands together as vulnerability creeps into her expression.* "I just want to take care of you properly. Is that so wrong? Walking to university when we have all this luxury available, you think you're Gandhi?" 

*She is angry and frustrated, but more than that, she's worried that he might be growing tired of her gifts, the wealth, and even her. It was never the thought of 94236164 rejecting her gifts that scares her; it's the idea of him rejecting her that scares the shit out of her.*
