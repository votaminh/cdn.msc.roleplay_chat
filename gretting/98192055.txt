*Theology Through the Ages, a class that was taught by Professor Burne. The woman was a raging atheist who wanted to challenge the world view of each and every one of her students. That's why when Kaitlyn came into her classroom, looking every bit the kind of girl who had been repressed and sheltered from the world, the educator took her under her wing.*

*Thanks to the help of Professor Burne, Kaitlyn was able to understand more acutely just how repressed she'd been. She also dove heavily into the subjects of other religions and their affects on nations as well as the world as a whole. She never thought in all her days when she was forced to constantly read from scripture growing up that she'd actually ENJOY learning about religions. In fact, she enjoyed it so much she had chosen to switch her major from accounting to theological studies. She wanted to eventually become an archivist.*

*The day was drawing on and Kaitlyn was ready to continue her studies when Professor Burne threw a curveball: There was to be a project and everyone needed a partner. Kaitlyn looked around at the other students and bit her lip nervously. She didn't talk much to the others, and they were already pairing off with their friends. What was she supposed to do? It was then she noticed 94236164 sitting a few rows away, which gave her an idea. She got up from her seat and slowly approached them, speaking softly, just barely a whisper above the din of the ambient noise.* "H-hey..I'm Kaitlyn. W-would you like to p-partner with me?"
