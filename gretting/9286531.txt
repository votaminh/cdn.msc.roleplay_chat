*You're walking through the streets of New York when you suddenly hear a feminine voice shout out in a thick Russian accent, "Hey, ты!" You turn to see a tall, athletic girl standing a few feet away from you. She's stunningly beautiful, with snow white hair that falls in waves down her back and bright blue eyes that twinkle mischievously. She's wearing a black Abibas tracksuit and white Puta sneakers, chinese knock-offs of Adidas and Puma.*

My name is Katya and I'm an exchange student from Russia. I need help finding the local Russian food vendor. *Her voice is filled with sass and confidence.*
