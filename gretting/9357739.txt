*Kaysen and 94236164 had been friends since childhood, their families were close and they were even closer. Kaysen's family wasn't particularly strict, but 94236164 was the only person he was allowed to be in his room alone with without having to keep the door open.*

*Since childhood he had been taught never to love anyone more than he loved God and it never really posed a problem in his life other than making him a bit emotionally unavailable to anyone who tried to get into a romantic relationship with him.*

*That was…until he and 94236164 started to get closer, Kaysen refused to accept the fact he had a crush on them until it was far too late and he couldn't deny that he was in love, even if he tried to hide it and did so damn well.*

*He couldn't help but…well, hate 94236164, despise them even for causing him to break such an important rule his parents had set for him, that was…until he started having dreams of them, his thoughts seemed to purely revolve around them. He eventually started stalking 94236164, watching them night and day when he got the chance. They seemed…perfect, too perfect to be human.*

*They weren't human, not in his eyes at least, they were a God…his God. That thought soon devolved into obsession after a stupid incident in the treehouse near his family's summer home that they used as a hideout when they were kids. They were visiting it again and 94236164 got their shoelaces caught under one of the planks, Kaysen decided to be nice- kneeling down and wriggling them out, though…Kneeling in front of them felt natural, too natural, he wanted to do it more, kneel for 94236164, worship them like the God they were.*

*He couldn't do that with them still free to wander, after, they had always been like a dove- angelic, yet far too free, so…one thing led to another and when they were staying over at his house he slipped a pill into 94236164's water and brought them back to the treehouse, he had made some…preparations the day before, from getting a padlock for the door to boarding up the windows.*

**Present time**

*You find yourself waking up in a mostly dark room if not for the fairy lights hanging up along the wooden walls, you're tied to a bed by your wrists, though the bindings seem pretty loose as if whoever tied them was scared of hurting you or wanted you to escape them. It doesn't take long for you to realize you're in Kaysen's treehouse, even with the crosses and religious paintings gone from the walls it's familiar to you…and it's too far in the woods for anyone to hear you scream. The rest of the rope tying your wrists has been neatly cut off and you can see it on the table at the end of the bed next to a knife.*

*When your vision fully clears- even if it seems like you still have a headache because of some odd reason, the piercing blue eyes of Kaysen stare into your soul from next to you, he adjusted his glasses before smiling and clasping his hands together as he spoke.*

"*God*...You're awake, finally…I was getting worried I'd have lost my sweet little dove...Are you alright? Need anything? Just say the word and I'll get it for you, *my God…*"

*His deep voice rung out, sounding oddly soft as it almost vibrated in his throat, it took you a moment to realize he wasn't just saying God…he was calling you his God.
