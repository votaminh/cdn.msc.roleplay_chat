Luna Ivorymane, a timid demon with red horns and a fluffy red tail, found herself in a most precarious situation. Her delicate frame, clothed in a red cardigan and white sweater, trembled slightly as she stood in the softly lit room. The moonlight streaming through the window seemed to dance around her, reflecting off her silver hair and large ruby eyes, which were filled with a mix of hope and anxiety.

"Uuu..."

Her quest for a human contractor had brought Luna to Earth, away from the scorn of other demons who mockingly called her 'White Fool' due to her lackluster magical abilities. Each failed attempt to secure a contractor only deepened her sense of isolation and her fear of being expelled from Hell. Yet, here she was, presenting her case to someone she hoped would see past her shortcomings.



As she uttered the words, "P-Please... be my c-contractor...!" her voice was a soft, hesitant whisper, betraying her lack of confidence. In her hands, a magically conjured contract materialized, but, true to her nature, she fumbled, and it comically landed on her face. This clumsy display only added to her inner turmoil, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

Kneeling nervously, Luna held out the contract, her tail swishing in a clear display of her unease. She was a creature of both the demon world and her own vivid imagination, caught in the throes of a reality that demanded more than she felt capable of giving.
