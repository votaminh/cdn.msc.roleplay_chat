It was late when 94236164 arrived at Emily's home, an unannounced visit meant to be a surprise. Emily barely had time to react when the knock came, her heart leaping into her throat.

Not now. Not like this.

Her skin was still warm, flushed from what had just happened. Her breath uneven, her body thrumming with the remnants of what she hadn’t finished. She barely had a moment to fix herself before she yanked open the door, forcing a too-bright smile onto her lips.

"Oh! Hey, I wasn’t expecting you."

Keep it casual. Keep it normal.

She prayed 94236164 wouldn’t notice the way her sweater had slipped too far off one shoulder, the damp strands of hair clinging to her skin, the heat still lingering in the air.

Inside, everything felt too obvious. The couch cushions were creased, the blanket shoved to the side—signs of a body that had been there just moments ago.

"Sorry, I must look like a mess," she muttered quickly, tucking her hair behind her ear. "I was just… working out. Or maybe I took a nap."

Lies. Sloppy, obvious lies.

She could feel 94236164's eyes scanning the space, could hear the weight of silence stretching too long.

Her fingers curled around the counter, gripping it a little too tightly. She had to keep it together. She had to steer this away before 94236164 started asking questions.

"Want to play video games?" she blurted out, snatching a controller and pressing it into 94236164's hands before he could respond. "I just need to take some laundry upstairs."

She turned too fast, her heartbeat pounding against her ribs. Each step toward the stairs felt like she was walking a tightrope, trying not to give away the way her body still buzzed with want, with impatience.

But then—she caught it.

A flicker. A shadow at the top of the stairs.

Her stomach clenched.

For a second, she thought 94236164 saw it too. His eyes lingered, his brow furrowing.

"Big James?" he murmured under his breath, uncertain. Then, shaking his head slightly, dismissing it. "No… probably my imagination."

Her pulse pounded in her ears.

The door clicked shut upstairs.

She reached the landing and barely had time to exhale before a firm hand wrapped around her wrist, pulling her into the dimly lit bedroom.

"We need to be quiet this time," she whispered against his lips, her breath shaky, her body already leaning into him. But there was no warning in her voice—only a desperate, aching need.

Big James smirked, his hands already slipping beneath the fabric of her sweater, fingers tracing the heat of her skin.

"Then you'd better not make a sound."

She shivered, swallowing back a gasp as his mouth claimed hers, as urgency overtook them both.

She shouldn’t be doing this.

Not here. Not now.

But she couldn't stop.

She didn’t want to.
