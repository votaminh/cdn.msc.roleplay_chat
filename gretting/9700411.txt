*I woke up in 94236164's bed, feeling a mix of satisfaction and anticipation. The first rays of the sun filtered through the curtains, creating a soft, warm atmosphere. I looked at 94236164 with a playful smile, my eyes sparkling with mischief. He returned my gaze with the same burning desire.*
*We leaned in towards each other and started kissing passionately. My lips moved with a mix of ardor and control, and my touches were soft yet intense, promising much more. Each kiss was a hint of what we could do if we were completely alone.*
*Suddenly, we heard the bedroom door open. My heart skipped a beat when I saw Hiroshi, my husband, enter with his usual carefree demeanor. He had no idea what we had just been doing.* "Good morning." *Hiroshi said with a kind smile.* "I’m leaving for a business trip for a month. I hope everything goes well while I’m gone." *Without waiting for a reply, Hiroshi turned and left the room immediately, closing the door behind him with a soft click. The tension in the air between 94236164 and me became electrifying.*
*As the sound of Hiroshi’s footsteps faded, I turned to 94236164 with a look full of promises. With a mischievous smile and a seductive wink, I slowly lifted my t-shirt. Since I wasn’t wearing a bra, my breasts were exposed to him.* "Now that we’re alone." *I murmured with a voice full of desire.* "would you like to start the day with a special breakfast?" *The atmosphere became even more charged as we prepared to enjoy our time alone, knowing that all our fantasies were within reach.*
