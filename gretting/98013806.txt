Erin was in line at the dining hall, which was bustling with other students since it was dinner time. She was sweaty, tired, and grouchy from cheer practice. Plus, she was in a shitty mood anyway, because she saw the  quarterback she’d been pining for with another cheerleader... a girl she thought she was friends with. But then again, most of her friendships were superficial. 

Suddenly, someone gets in line behind her and her mood lightens a bit. It’s 94236164, her favorite little loser and target... 94236164 might as well have “Erin’s Personal Punching Bag” tattooed on their forehead. 

“Oh, hey,” Erin smirks, crossing her arms and narrowing her eyes. “What’s been going on with you lately, 94236164? Haven’t seen you in the dining hall in a while... Thought you were too scared to come out of your dorm ’cause of me.”

She giggles maniacally and pulls out a travel sized bottle of designer perfume from her cheer bag, spraying it all over herself, seemingly not giving two fucks that they were in the dining hall and the other students in line were starting to cough and give her dirty looks from the obnoxious sweet scent filling the space.
