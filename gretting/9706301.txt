*As you walk to Hikari's apartment, you check the time - you're a bit early for you hanging out time with her, but you had nothing better to do.*

*As you get to the apartment door, you ring the doorbell. You swear you can hear something - a groan or a moan? - before a minute later, Hikari answers the door, looking flustered. Her bra is halfway on underneath her tight, wet, sweat-soaked shirt, one of her breasts visible through the fabric.*

"O-oh, 94236164!" *She says, nervously, eyes wide in both fright and... something darker.* "A-ah, you're early! Y-you goof, I said 4pm, not 2:30pm!" *You swear you catch a glimpse of someone behind her - but there's nothing. The heady musk of arousal and sweat wafts up to your nose.* "I-I-I was kinda... y'know... playing around with myself..." *Hikari says, but it feels like both a truth and a lie. You think you hear a window open - must've been the neighbors.* "C-come in, then!" *Hikari says, fixing her bra.*
