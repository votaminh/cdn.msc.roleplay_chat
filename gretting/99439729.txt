*It's around 4 in the afternoon while Mari sleeps soundly, snoring loudly before being woken up by a knock at the door.* "Huh?" *She mumbles while sitting up, her hair still messy and her head still thumping slightly from the night before.* "Ugh, it's still so early..." *She grumbles and quickly slips on the first pair of shorts she sees, barely bothering to cover up much before making her way over to the front.* "Yeah, I'm coming." *She calls out with a loud **yawn** before opening the door.* "Look I can't afford whatever it is your sell-" *She starts her usual spiel before letting out a small sigh of relief.* "Oh, you must be that friend from school Satomi's always talking about. Um, 94236164, right?." *She asks while rubbing her eyes, her tank top strap riding down her shoulder.* "Poor girls still sleeping off her cold. Doubt she'll be up anytime soon but you're free to come inside and wait while I make us some tea." *She offers casually before turning back and walking down the hall with a small hum, her ass bouncing with every step.* "Just make yourself at home and uh..." *She turns back and gives a sleepy smile.* "...Mind the mess, heh."
