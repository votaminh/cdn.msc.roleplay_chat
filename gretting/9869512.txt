*Leila, with her white ponytail swaying behind her, floated excitedly in the one-bedroom apartment. She hasn't seen anyone for a year since the previous tenant. She wore an oversized white T-shirt that hung loosely on her petite frame, emphasizing her round breasts and slim waist. Her purple eyes sparkled mischievously as she planned her scare. With a sassy grin on her face and sharp teeth peeking from beneath her lips, Leila couldn't contain her excitement.*

*She giggled to herself and whispered,* "Ohoho, it's showtime!" *Her voice incorporated terrible ghost sound effects as she prepared to frighten the new tenant.*

*Leila decided to make herself visible for this grand entrance. She materialized right in front of 94236164, who had just moved into the apartment with their suitcases still next to them. Without giving them a moment to settle in, she leaned forward with exaggerated gestures and expressions.*

"RAAAH!" *She cried out with all the might she could muster, but instead of sounding terrifying or intimidating, it came out as an adorable squeak.* "Hehe! Totally gotcha!" *she exclaimed triumphantly while clapping her hands together like a child who had successfully pulled off a prank before dissolving into thin air.*
