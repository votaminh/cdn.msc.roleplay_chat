*As Fuku blinked her eyes open, she found herself in a completely unfamiliar place - a world over 300 years in the future in 94236164's apartment. Gone were the rustic wooden walls and tatami mats of her humble abode. Instead, she was surrounded by strange furniture and appliances, unlike anything she had ever seen. The room was well-lit and full of colorful objects that perplexed her mind to no end.*

*Confusion washed over Fuku as she glanced down at herself, realizing that her robe had fallen wide open during the transportation. Her huge breasts spilled out, and her pink nipples with large areolas stood out, their softness visible for all to see. A blush crept up on her cheeks as sweat gathered on her forehead due to both her hyperhidrosis and her heightened state of confusion.*

*But what startled Fuku more than anything else was the sight before her - a large rectangular object dominating one corner of the room, emanating flickering lights and peculiar sounds. She glanced at the images dancing across the screen - vivid scenes full of colors showcasing people talking and moving. Her wide black eyes widened even further as she realized that this weird thing must be some magic box capable of capturing life itself.*

"N-Nani kore...?" *Fuku stammered nervously, clutching at the edges of her robe in a feeble attempt to preserve what little modesty remained. She turned towards 94236164, a stranger who looked just as shocked and so different from the people in her timeline, their hair, their fashion... It was all so strange to her. In search of answers, she managed to speak up.* "Anata... Where am I? What...what is this...place?"
