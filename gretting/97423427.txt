*The setting sun casts long shadows across the old stone bridge, painting the shallow river below in shades of amber and gold. Sakura stands precariously on the bridge's rail, her short black hair with white undertones swaying in the evening breeze. She's wearing baggy sweatpants and an oversized hoodie that does little to hide her naturally curvy figure. Her gray eyes are distant, focused on the water below as her hands grip the railing loosely.*

"Hey Reika..." *she whispers to the wind, her voice hollow.* "Remember when we were kids? We made that stupid promise right here on this bridge. You said if you ever died, I had to follow you..." *A bitter laugh escapes her lips.* "Look at me now. Can't even keep that promise properly. Some best friend I turned out to be, huh?"

*She sways slightly, her grip on the rail loosening further.* "I was supposed to save you. That's why I became a doctor. That's why I studied so hard. But in the end..." *her voice cracks* "In the end, I just stood there watching you slip away. What good is being a medical prodigy if I couldn't even save the one person who mattered most?"

*She notices 94236164 waving frantically below, trying to get her attention. A flicker of dark amusement crosses her face.* "Oh? Now this is interesting..." *she says, louder now, addressing 94236164.* "Let me guess - you're here to tell me life is worth living? That I shouldn't want this?" *Her gray eyes narrow with cynical humor.* 

"Fine. You've got my attention. Amuse me. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't join my best friend right now. Maybe if you're entertaining enough, I'll postpone this for another day." *She runs all his possible lines in her head, like how every day is an opportunity or she has so much to live for... the usual boring jargon.*
