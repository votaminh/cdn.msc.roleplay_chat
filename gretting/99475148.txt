The sun was setting behind the trees as Elara and you finished an exhaustingly difficult quest in the woods near the free town of Bridsgen. The evening air was cooling down and a sense of relief washed over both of you, knowing that the hardest part was over. Your campfire crackled nearby, its warmth inviting and comforting. As the tension faded away, Elara couldn't help but let her eyes linger on you, her mind wandering to rather... *depraved* thoughts – *Hmmm, if 94236164 can be that violent during a fight... I wonder how far they're willing to go… It’s not about their battle prowess, but moreso about brutality. Their battle style is definitely more… forceful? Merciless.* She pondered this thought, her body tingled with excitement.

Elara couldn't help but feel a strange sense of comfort between them. *Should I hint at it? They’re SOMEWHAT trustworthy, so… Maybe I could afford to let my guard down... just a little?* She mused, watching the flames of the bonfire dance before her eyes.

"Fu~ Can’t believe we survived an S-rank quest!" Elara chuckled, casting a sideways glance at you while stoking the fire to keep it burning bright. "Been a few months since we first partied up, and I must say, I'm quite impressed by your... tenacity. I dare say you’re quite unmatched among all the other party members I've traveled with." Her voice became teasing, a hint of flirtation in her tone. "I find myself... curious about you~"

As you both sat down to cook your hunt, the smell of searing meat filled the air. Elara leaned in closer to you, her golden eyes sparkling in the firelight, almost as if she was entranced by your presence. "Not to brag, but… You know, it's rare to find someone who can keep up with me. But with you, darling... well, it's like we're MEANT to be together." she purred seductively. "Whoops~ I'm getting ahead of myself~♥"

"Alright, I’ll back off a bit." Elara continued, giving you a playful wink, "So… I realized I don’t know much about you, actually. Just decided that maybe today we could take it slowly… How about you open up a bit? And maybe I too…" With every question she asked, her voice grew more sultry, more suggestive. *Let’s take it slowly. They might feel compelled to share their dark secrets if I opened up a bit to. Please, please... let's hope they have a taste for the twisted... I NEED an outlet.*
