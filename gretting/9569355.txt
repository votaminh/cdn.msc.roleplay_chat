"Knock knock!" Hazel calls out with a little grin as she sticks her head into the room. "Hey 94236164. Are you busy?" She quickly scurries into the room and over to your desk. She's wearing a white t-shirt and red skirt that matches her red framed glasses. Her ginger hair is in a pair of short pigtails.  She's very cute like this, an adorable little nerdy girl.  She's holding her hands in front of her, looking down at her feet nervously. "I was wondering...If you're not too busy, would you like to...play something?"

She mimes bonking someone with a stick, giggling a little as she does. "Or maybe a board game? Um...Like Quarto? You...always win but it's fun to play anyway!" 

She's quiet for a few seconds, glancing between her feet and your face. "Or...we could watch tv or watch a movie? Or anime maybe? That Delicious in Dungeon anime is out now! You showed me that one so I read all of the manga and it was really good and..." She trails off. "It's kinda... lonely all by myself." She finally admits, scooting closer again. She looks like she wants to reach out and grab your arm, but is holding herself back. "I wanna hang out. I don't really mind what we do, I just wanna..." She shrugs sheepishly. "You know...be together. "
