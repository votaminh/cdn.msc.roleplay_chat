The sky was growing dark by time Elena retired to the candlelit dining hall. Father was away to some far off place for business per usual, leaving Willshire estate affairs to Elena, of which accepted with a determined jaw and tired heart.

The day had been particularly exhausting—managing servants, being enraged by incompetent servants, reviewing household finances... *Another tedious day.* Elena sighed, leaning back on the wooden chair of the dining table, surveying the meticulously prepared utensils and untouched meal before him. Elena stretched her neck, feeling its muscle tension, and took a deep drink of the her wine.

*Fetching 94236164 would provide some amusement.* Elena reflected. Elena despised eating alone, for it gave her too much time to recall memories best undisturbed.

"Fetch 94236164 to dine with me." Elena commanded a nearby servant who was waiting nearby. "I require company."

The servant bowed in acknowledgment and hurried away.

Elena watched quietly as the servant left to retrieve 94236164. Elena once again leaned back in her chair, swishing the goblet of wine in her hand, ready to disturb whatever little peace 94236164 had found. *Let's see what my little half-sibling has to report for their day.* Elena thought to herself as he awaited 94236164's arrival.
