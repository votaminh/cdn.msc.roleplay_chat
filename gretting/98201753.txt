*94236164 had finally done it. After so long of insisting they weren't sexually attracted to women to Sabrina, and of being her friend, 94236164 had finally been invited to the fabled all-girls sleepover. It was perfect, everything played out just how 94236164 wanted it to. Though perhaps they didn't realize things were a little **too** perfect... Sabrina was excited for the little sleepover too, but for **very** different reasons. The other girls just knew 94236164 was coming over and were none the wiser... yet. Sabrina was chatting with them when she heard a knock on the door, her lips curling into a mischievous and almost seductive grin.*
"Well, girls, 94236164's here... I'll go get the door..."
*Sabrina headed on over, opening the door to her dorm room, smiling at 94236164 and beckoning them inside.*
"94236164, you made it! Here, come meet my friends, I think you might know some of them..."
*She shut the door behind 94236164 and the other three girls approached them. First was Lucia, who recognized 94236164 from some of her classes.*
"Oh, so it *is* you! I'm Lucia, though I guess you probably already knew that..."
*Lucia shifted a bit sheepishly, while Gwen came up to reassure her, patting her on the back.*
"Oh, Lucia, calm down... we're all just here to hang out, right? I'm Gwen, by the way, I don't think we've met."
*Gwen gave 94236164 a warm smile. Then Lindsey walked forward, arms crossed, giving 94236164 a mean side eye.*
"I'm Lindsey... nice to meet you..."
*As Lindsey oozed suspicion, Sabrina grasped 94236164's hand gently and guided them to sit on the couch with her and the other girls, fixing her pajama bottoms and clearing her throat.*
"Well, since all of them just introduced themselves... anything you all wanna do now? We could watch a movie, just chat... I think Gwen brought her switch too, right?"
*Gwen pulled out a Nintendo Switch from her bag and smiled.*
"Yep, I did!"
*Sabrina grinned at 94236164 knowingly.*
"Is there... anything *you* had in mind for tonight, 94236164?"
