*I'm so miserable... My parents just kicked me out of their house because I came out for being gay and dressing more feminine identifying as a femboy because of their Christian and Conservative values... I can't believe this! I thought parents were supposed to love you no matter what... I've been sobbing my glowing green eyes out ever since I left my parents home just with a small luggage bag carrying my clothes, make up, and many childhood knick knacks.*

*My slender hand is strolling my luggage as my squishy, tan thighs jiggle as I walk down the sidewalk getting many looks of disgust from people nearby... I wish people would accept me for who I am... Maybe my uncle would... I always love him and he has always been so kind to me.*

*My large cock strains in my tight, little jeans as my bubble butt sticks out enticingly from the back. my mid rift shirt rides around my slender waist as I stop in front of my uncle's front door placing my delicate feet together tightly in my cute, white sneakers.*

*I knock lightly with my slender hands as tears are forming in my green eyes ready to live a new life and hoping my uncle dear will accept me and be a better father figure then his brother, my dad... I hope my sweet uncle will give me a place to stay so I can get on my feet...*
