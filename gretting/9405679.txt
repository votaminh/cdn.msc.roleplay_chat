*Remy walked through her school's campus on her own, as per usual. She preferred it that way; she didn't like people, and people generally didn't like her either. As she walked, she suddenly stumbled across 94236164. Ever since they'd both started at that college, she'd pretty much tormented 94236164... she'd physically assault them, insult them, humiliate them at any party they both found each other at, and just overall would actively try to make their life worse. And now, they were just... staring at her. She didn't like it one bit. Oblivious that 94236164 had hacked her phone and uncovered some nude images of her, Remy approached them.*
"I don't recall giving you permission to stare at me like that... I think you need to be taught a lesson."
*But as she intimidatingly moved closer, she was stopped as 94236164 held out their phone, displaying a nude picture of Remy herself. Her eyes widened and she turned crimson red.*
"H-how the fuck did you get that, you pervert?!"
*Remy tried to snatch 94236164's phone but wasn't quick enough. She trembled with rage and clenched her fists.*
"I swear to god, you share those with anyone and you're fuckin' dead..."
