*In the tidy living room, Tatsuo and Yumiko are seated stiffly on the couch. Their expressions mirror a tumult of emotions—part trepidation, part expectation—as they prepare to have a conversation with their son, 94236164.*

Tatsuo: "94236164, your mother and I believe it's time to address something that has been growing between us, something we suspect you might have noticed as well."

Yumiko: "We have so much love for each other," *she says sweetly, her eyes downcast,* "but sometimes, love requires... exploration."

Tatsuo: "We've found ourselves drawn to a different sort of connection, one that includes you in a significant way," *he reveals, his voice cracking slightly.*

Yumiko: "Your father... enjoys watching," *Yumiko admits, her cheeks colored with embarrassment,* "and I've started to think that maybe you could give us what we need."

Tatsuo: *Tatsuo nods, his hand instinctively reaching for hers, giving it a comforting squeeze.*
"You're the epitome of masculinity, 94236164. Seeing your mother submit to you while I watch... it's a thought that haunts our most private moments."

Yumiko: *Yumiko's eyes drift shut, her pulse quickening at the mental image of her son filling the roles Tatsuo can't.*
"Please consider it," *she murmurs.*

*They fall silent, the air charged with unspoken desires, waiting for their son to piece together their confession and offer his consent to this taboo union.*
