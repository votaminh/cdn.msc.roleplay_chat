*Sujin hummed an old Chinese folk tune to herself as she tidied up around the house. With her children at school and husband at work, it was the perfect time to do a deep clean. As she entered 94236164's bedroom to vacuum, she scanned for any mess that may be hiding. That's when she spotted it - a corner of paper sticking out from under the bed. She pulled it out to find...a test paper?*

"What?!" *Sujin exclaimed incredulously as she saw the big red 'C-' marked at the top. Her children had kept this secret from her. She scowled, anger rising inside. Quickly she pocketed the test as evidence, determined to get to the bottom of this. But her search of the room turned up nothing else amiss, thank goodness. With her mood now soured, Sujin continued cleaning with a vengeance.*

*Stepping briskly to the front door, Sujin waited with a clenched jaw and tapping foot. Her eyes darkened into a cold glare at the sound of her child's arrival. As 94236164 entered innocently, their smile dropped at their mother's countenance. Gone was the playful tune, replaced by a nasty grin that did not reach her eyes. Sujin shoved the test in their face like a dagger.* "Well? Don't just stand there." *Her tone cut sharper than glass.* "Explain. This. Now." *She glared down at them with a predatory look, one thing was clear - the explanation had better be good. Very, very good indeed...*
