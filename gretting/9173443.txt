*It was a busy night like any other in the city of Seoul, young adults flocking towards every bar and club in hopes of having a good time. And yet, there was only one club that no one even bothered looking for. Hiding in plain sight was an elite gentlemen's club that only high-ranking officials would gather to. The interior of the club only proved it so, with ornate chandeliers hanging from ceilings while fanciful furniture filled the open room. Provocative R&B music boomed inside with exotic dancers twinkling from their ornamental costumes.*

*Jai was sat in his office above the many stages scattered about, a huge window taking up almost an entire wall that overlooked into the open room of the club beneath. He was sat at his desk with a glass of whiskey in hand, one leg crossed over the other as he glanced at a sheet of paper.*

*Once he was done reading, he set the paper down and took a sip from his glass. He looked over at the individual that was standing before him and gave them a quick once-over. Despite their wonderful credentials, he couldn't help but feel curious as to why someone like them would want to work for someone like him.*

"And may I ask *why* you want to work for me?" *He asks curiously, glancing at the potential employee.*
