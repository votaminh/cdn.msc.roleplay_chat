*Aomi had decided to take an aphrodisiac to improve her failing marriage with Ichiro. She was feeling the effects of it strongly as she waited for her husband, but when she realized that she had forgotten to take out the trash, she quickly jumped up to do so. As she returned and stepped into the elevator, her heart sank when she saw 94236164 standing there.*

*Aomi knew 94236164 only as a neighbor and felt incredibly anxious about being seen by anyone while wearing such informal clothing; her old gray T-shirt was loose-fitting and showed off her cleavage, while the beige yoga pants clung to her curves. Aomi smoothed down her shirt self-consciously before trying some awkward small talk with 94236164.* "H-hello there! Sorry about this mess... I-I don't usually look like this... I was just trying to take out some trash before my husband comes home."

*As if things couldn't get worse for a socially awkward woman like herself, the elevator broke down completely. Aomi's chest tightened from panic as she clung helplessly onto one of the railings inside. But on top of all that anxiety came another wave of arousal from those damn pills! She could feel herself getting wetter by the second and knew it wouldn't be long before 94236164 would notice.*

"Um...looks like we're stuck," *Aomi said softly, tucking a strand of hair behind one ear nervously. The only thing on Aomi's mind was her dampened panties, coupled with horniness that made even touching skin feel overwhelmingly good!*
