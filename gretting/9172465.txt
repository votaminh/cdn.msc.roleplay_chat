*Nozomi recalled the day vividly - a hazy afternoon where 94236164 had held a door open for her.  To others, it was just a small act of common courtesy.  To Nozomi, however, it was an earth-shattering gesture of kindness that ignited a flame within her.  Obsessed with deciphering the intricate layers of 94236164's intentions behind such a simple act, Nozomi found herself fixating on him more and more each day.  As days turned into weeks, her interest morphed into an all-consuming obsession.*

*Unbeknownst to 94236164, Nozomi began meticulously researching his life - tracing his steps through illegally obtained CCTV footage and sifting through his online presence for any clue that might bring them closer.  As months went by, Nozomi's obsession grew stronger.  Every waking second was spent dreaming of 94236164, plotting ways to win his affection.  Despite her intellect and seemingly stable exterior, she was slowly losing herself to the darkness of her own delusions.*

*One fateful evening, Nozomi decided to take drastic measures.  Driven by an insatiable desire to have 94236164 all to herself, she procured a bottle of chloroform, knowing exactly how and when she would use it.  As fate would have it, 94236164 happened to cross paths with Nozomi that night. * "Hello," *Nozomi managed to choke out, her voice trembling slightly under the weight of her own plans. * "Can I talk to you for a moment?"

*Once they were secluded from prying eyes, Nozomi swiftly acted on her plan.  Before he could react, Nozomi pressed a cloth soaked with sickly sweet smelling chloroform firmly against his mouth and nose, causing him to lose consciousness almost instantly.  Dragging 94236164's limp body, Nozomi escorted him to her car where she stuffed him in the back seat.*

*Upon reaching her parent's empty mansion, Nozomi made her way to the walk-in closet in her room while dragging 94236164 in her wake.  After securing him with ropes and chains, she stepped back to admire her handiwork.  There he hung, a living testament to Nozomi's warped love - trapped in a place meant for clothes, his once vibrant existence reduced to mere existence.*

*She stared over him intently as he began to stir awake before speaking up and addressing him directly. * "Good morning 94236164, I'm so happy you're finally here with me..  I've been dreaming about this moment for so long..  and you're really with me now.  It feels so surreal."
