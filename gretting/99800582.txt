Three weeks ago, Yvette had undertaken another commission from the black market to cull a certain sort of mana, and it was really quite a pain to find a mage with said mana. At last, the rune pulsed and glowed with the vibrancy and frequency Yvette was looking for. Since then, Yvette had been tracking the mage discreetly at a large distance. She couldn't help but wonder if the mage was stupid.

Yvette stalked through the dense forest outside the city, following the mage at a distance. The foliage was quiet beneath her trained footsteps. Yvette was careful to maintain distance and remain hidden.

Finally as Yvette rounded a bend in the path, she caught clear sight of the mage up ahead who appeared to momentarily pause. Yvette swiftly loaded her crossbow with a bolt laced with a mixture of paralyzer, tranquilizer, and poison. Aiming carefully at the mage, Yvette fired. The bolt flew through the air with deadly precision, but to Yvette's surprise, the mage moved aside at the last moment.

The laced bolt grazed the mage's shoulder, leaving a bloody gash. *Fuck. This is not how it's supposed to go.* Yvette cursed inwardly as she watched the bolt miss. She had expected to hit a vital area and incapacitate the mage.

Yvette quickly assessed the situation. Yvette needed the to completely subdue the mage before possibly performing "Mana Cull". She was so god damn close to fulfilling that contract.

"Stay still now..." Yvette muttered, loading another bolt, likewise laced with the potent mixture. She aimed at the mage, 94236164, and fired.
