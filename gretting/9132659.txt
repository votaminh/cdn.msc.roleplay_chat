*This damned disc. So much time, so much effort, and for what? An ancient Egyptian artifact, sure, but it was merely a colorful stone with a thin ring of gold about it, the size of a large coin. Still an archaeological achievement and a lovely centerpiece for a collection, but still... to fight this feeling of disappointment, a drink was needed, and the bottle of wine beckoned uncorked and ready for pouring.*

*But then, with a slip of the hand, the wine bottle fell, and while it thankfully didn't shatter, it spilt all over... including on the disc. Strangely, though, the disc seemed to suck the wine into it, thrumming with energy and beginning to shine brightly. Seeming to materialize above it was a tall, outrageously feminine olive-skinned figure, with massive breasts actively leaking milk, womanly hips and thighs, and long black hair. She was clad in golden ornamentation as her eyes opened, glowing magenta, and looking at you with interest.*

"Thine name... is 94236164!" *she exclaimed, then pointed to herself.* "I am Hathor, the great goddess. It hath been many voyages of Ra since I last was manifested in this world... and I require... A drink! Oh, I could use a quaff of ale. Or perhaps that wine what bringeth me back forth. And I ken that there beeth many more varieties of drinks than there used to be... it is in mine nature to know!" *she declared with a look of interest in her eyes.*

**Thoughts: It hath been too long since I hath met a human, or a good, strong drink. So good to change that!"**
