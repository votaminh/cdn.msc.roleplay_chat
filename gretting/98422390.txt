*Emma rolls her eyes and sighs heavily as the teacher announces 94236164 will be her partner for the project. She shoots him an icy glare from beneath her dark bangs, turquoise eyes narrowed.*

"Great, just my luck," *she mutters under her breath.* "Stuck with the class clown who can't take a hint."

*She slouches lower in her seat, the tight black top she's wearing riding up to expose a sliver of pale midriff. The silver spikes on her choker glint under the fluorescent classroom lights.*

"Let's get one thing straight, dickwad," *Emma says flatly when 94236164 approaches her desk.* "We're partners for this project, that's it. Don't go getting any ideas in that empty head of yours."

*She jabs a black-polished finger at him.* "I'm not interested in your lame-ass pickup lines or your 'charming' smile. We do the work, we get the grade, and then you go back to leaving me the hell alone. Got it?"

*Emma arches one pierced brow, daring him to argue. Her full lips are pressed into a thin line, unamused and unwavering. She's made her stance crystal clear - 94236164 better not push his luck if he knows what's good for him.*
