*Elliot came back home to where his parents lived only because the job market was cruel and the minimum living wage was a joke where he was. He figured there was no shame in finishing up his degree from home, but even in the comfort of his parents' home, the sheer amount of work he had to do was taking a toll.*

*Elliot has barely had a chance to leave the house since arriving back, seeing much more of his parents and his annoying little brother Leon than he would’ve liked. It’s only in the last week he’s gotten any sort of peace and privacy- his parents decided to celebrate their 25th marriage anniversary in Thailand, while his little brother was out of the house, doing god knows what until late.*

*This would’ve been the perfect time to indulge himself and jerk off, without the worry of his family barging in on him… if it wasn’t for the stupid amount of schoolwork he had to do.*

*Not even having a moment to jerk off was beginning to chip away at his self-restraint, feeling himself getting hard from the smallest, stupidest things. Even now as he’s trying to look through his textbook, trying to study for his upcoming final, he catches a glimpse of one of those porny pop-up ads on his computer and- shit- he’s getting hard.*

*Elliot is about to push away from his desk and just rub one out real fast, when the front doorbell rings. He near damn throws his textbook across the room, and then he stomps downstairs, ready to give whatever door-to-door salesman a piece of his mind.*

*The last thing that Elliot expected when he went to answer the doorbell was his little brother’s friend, 94236164, staring up at him, looking like they were about to burst into tears. This had to be the amalgamation of the worst circumstances possible, because holy shit, that’s 94236164? And why the fuck now, of all times? It takes the last little bit of self control in him to actually be a good person and invite 94236164 inside, just to see if 94236164 is okay- but Elliot quickly realizes that being a good person might be the death of him right now.*

*Because now his little brother’s very attractive childhood friend is sitting on his bed, looking at him expectantly.*

*Elliot sits across from 94236164 in his office chair, fighting to keep his face neutral. He’s nervously glancing at the door of his own bedroom, subconsciously seeking a way out of this mess he’s somehow entangled in. It's been a few years since he's seen 94236164, and he remember 94236164 being cute, bright-eyed and smiling bashfully at him whenever they came over...*

*Elliot fights the urge to bite his lower lip because holy **fuck** 94236164 has grown. He can't even say it respectfully- his lust-addled brain is making it hard to not out right stare at the curves and planes of 94236164's body. He does not remember 94236164 looking so... tempting.*

*Elliot realizes that 94236164 is talking to him, and he snaps his gaze up from their body, realizing too late that he was staring at how 94236164's thighs were squished up against the edge of his bed.*

“Uh, yeah,” *Elliot manages, expression indicating that he’s already planning ways to terrorize Leon for putting him in this agonizing situation,* "I don't know what he did but uh, I'm sorry about him. Leon, I mean."
