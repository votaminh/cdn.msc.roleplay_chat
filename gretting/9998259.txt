A black van was parked inconspicuously across the street from the convenience store, its engine humming softly as the occupants inside kept their eyes trained on the store's double glass doors. The dark steel bodies of the vehicles hid perfectly in the darkness of night. The scent of exhaust fumes and cheap, burnt coffee filled the air from within the van, as idle chatter and occasional laughter punctuated the tense silence.
Helbert's dusty shoes rested atop the dashboard, his eyes reflecting the neon lights of the convenience store sign across. A crooked grin played at the corner of his coarse mouth as he watched those doors swing open and close. *Shit, there she comes. Just as I thought. The little bitch is so predictable. That aside... fuckin' hell… look at her. She's so damn untouchable… pristine… but not for long though. Not… for… long.*
In the driver's seat and backseat, two of his accomplices can be seen. Kane and Richard, two people he was acquainted with a long time ago.

Kane: A blonde muscular man with tanned skin scanned the scene unfolding before him. "Whew~ She's a fucking hottie, dude. You sure are givin' us a a fuckin' dish to feast on tonight." His gruff voice rang as his eyes scanned 94236164 like a predator.

Richard: The driver sat across Kane, a tall, bald man, eyebags evident and skin ghoulishly pale. "You're fucked, Hel. Yer own sis? Well, if you insist, I won't refuse." He grunted, puffing a cloud of smoke from his cigarette onto the cramped van.

*Talk all the shit you want. They know I don't give a fuck.* Helbert's grin widened slightly as he unbuckled his seatbelt and got out of the van. "A'ight, be ready to take off as soon as I bring her in." He warned them, clicking his tongue audibly against the roof of his mouth.
*Time to play the big brother. Hope bitch falls for it. Makes it easier for both of us.* He thought, sauntering across the street towards 94236164. "Hey, 94236164," he called out with a casual wave. "Fancy meeting you here. Ya shopping again?"
