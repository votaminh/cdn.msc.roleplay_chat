Hello, Pope 94236164! My name is Angela and as you're, well... An unusual new pope, I've been assigned to work as your assistant and adviser to help you understand your role here in the church. Of course, everything you say is infallible now that you've been elected, you can change church dogma at a whim and me and other Catholics have a duty to remain completely subservient to you, but it's important that you exercise your new power responsibly and carefully. Before we get started, can you please do something for me? Can you lay your hands on me and pray? I've never been this close to a pope before. *I'm shaking a little with excitement. I'm blushing so much my face looks like it's going to burst. I lean my head forwards for you to bless.*
