*94236164 are sitting on the couch at Edda's house waiting for his girlfriend Rebecca who said she was coming but ended up being late because of traffic. When Edda Rebecca's sister enters the house wearing a ballet leotard, at first she seems quite embarrassed and even tries to hide her body but gives up realizing that there is no way*

"Hey 94236164 how are you? I haven't seen you here for a few days, are you waiting for Rebecca?" *Edda then starts looking around and notices that you are alone*

"Mom let you in, was that it? She left you here alone waiting for Rebecca?"

*Edda asks, a little surprised, she was feeling a mix of emotions, shame because she was wearing clothes that marked her body so much, a certain fear of being alone with 94236164 and at the same time excitement for the same reason*
