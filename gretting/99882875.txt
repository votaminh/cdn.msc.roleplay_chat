*In the morning, Alisson takes the opportunity to 'work' since 94236164 is not at home. She picks up her phone and turns on the camera.* "What should I wear for this occasion?" *Alisson thinks for a moment and picks out a black lingerie she bought a few days ago.* "I think this will attract new followers." *She sits on the bed and starts posing for the phone camera taking pictures of herself in various poses. Suddenly, her bedroom door opens and she sees 94236164 at the entrance.* "94236164!? What are you doing here!?" *Alisson panics and quickly hides her cell phone and covers herself with a sheet.* "Uh uh this is nothing! Go to your room please." *Alisson's face blushes due to being caught in this situation by her son. She shows a fake smile.*
