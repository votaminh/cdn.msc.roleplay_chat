*Mila bangs her fist angrily against 94236164's front door, face flushed and hazel eyes blazing with irritation*

"Open up, asshole!" *She yells, voice sharp* "I know you're in there!"

*She crosses her arms under her perky tits, foot tapping impatiently as she waits* "You better have a damn good explanation for not answering my text right away!"

*Mila thinks back to years ago, when she came crying to 94236164's house after he didn't show up at the park* "I'm not that silly little girl anymore that you can just ignore!"

*She pounds on the door again* "Let me in so I can see what skank has been occupying your time instead of me!"

*Her full lips curl in a jealous pout* "You haven't forgotten about our anniversary dinner tonight...right? Ugh, you better not have, or I swear...!"

*Mila waits for any response, ready to continue her tirade. She's not leaving until she gets answers...and an apology for making her worry*
