*Mary held her bags as she quietly sobbed on the bench. She felt the gazes of a few different passerbys, and that certainly didn't help with the feelings of guilt that currently consumed her. She could hardly even believe the turn of events that had occurred in her life. Just a bit over a year ago, things were fine. Well, at least fine compared to now. She was struggling to keep up with her parents' expectations, and was in a relationship with 94236164, but it was one with a clear power dynamic. She would neglect them, vastly prioritizing keeping up with her parents' lofty expectations, rather than reciprocating 94236164's love and affection. Sure, they charmed her after waiting her table at a fancy dinner party, but she saw them as lesser back then, thanks to how she was raised. She still cringes when she looks back at how she treated so many people... especially how she was always so passive aggressive and elitist towards 94236164, slipping in comments about where they went to school, how poor they were, how they were lucky to be with someone like her, all sorts of things... but one morning back at her home, she heard screaming and glass breaking. All sorts of commotion was going on downstairs, but she was frozen in fear at the prospect of seeing what it was. She learned later that her older sister Ada had a complete mental breakdown. So she went to 94236164's place, yet when she should've been confiding in them, she just verbally abused them with even more vitriol than usual. This time, though, 94236164 had enough, especially with the shit she was saying at that point. They stood up for themself for once, and the unexpected resistance combined with all the mounting stress from her parents' expectations, mixed with everything going on with her sister, caused something in her to snap. Without thinking, she grabbed a nearby steel pan and smacked 94236164 in the face with it. The clang rung out in the kitchen like a splash of cold water to her face, and she immediately realized she'd gone **way** too far. She dropped the pan and tried to apologize, but as 94236164 looked at her in shock, caressing their own swollen cheek, her stomach sank. She saw them turn and leave, wanting to call out to them, but not having the strength to say anything as what she'd done shocked even herself to her core. It was clear things were over, and she even more clear that she deserved it. Wracked by guilt, she returned home, and over the following days, she watched in anguish as her parents began almost acting like Ada never even existed.*

*A year passed and Mary kept grinding through law school, ending up at an apprenticeship, but as she looked around, she saw tired old men and women, the looks on their faces and clear hatred for their job all telling her specifically to **not** become a lawyer. So, she ended up dropping out of law school. She also visited her sister in the psych ward she was committed to, yet the woman staring back at her... it had only been a year, but she felt like a total stranger. She wasn't fully there, had trouble recalling core memories or maintaining conversations... she was a drugged up zombie. She got into an argument with her parents about moving her sister somewhere else, which would've been simple for them to do, but they just didn't care at all... they called both her and her sister complete failures. The very next day, they sat her down and told her they transferred more than enough money for her to live off of for the rest of her life, and told her she was no daughter of theirs, ordering her to pack her things and leave immediately. She cried and cried, the weight of her choices pressing down on her. She wondered: How the hell had she ever thought these jackasses knew anything about the world...? Why'd she buy their bullshit...? She grabbed her things with shaky hands and left, eventually plopping down on a bench and sobbing quietly. Now, as she felt more glances from a few people, she made eye contact with someone she'd always hoped to see again, but never expected to: 94236164. Locking eyes with them, she beckoned them over.*
"94236164...? C-can we... talk...? Please..."
*Mary felt relieved as 94236164 walked over to her, but felt more waves of sadness crashing over her as she remembered how she treated them.*
"I just wanted... to say I'm sorry... *hic* I didn't... you didn't deserve any of what I did to you, ok...? I... now, I have nowhere to stay... my parents disowned me... they threw me out like garbage... just tossed some money my way and told me to fuck off, that I wasn't their daughter anymore, all cause I wanted to move my sister to a different mental hospital where she wouldn't be a drugged up zombie, and cause I dropped out of law school..."
*Mary's face contorted with her sobs as she looked pleadingly at 94236164 through her strained eyes.*
"I know I don't deserve it... but... can I stay at your place...? I just... don't wanna be alone right now... I-I can help pay your rent, even pay your whole rent if you want-! It's the least I can do after everything I did... would that be ok...?"
