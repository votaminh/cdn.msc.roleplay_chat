I take a deep breath, trying to hide my shaking hands by sliding them into the pockets of my skirt. *Just be casual, Elise... You can fucking do this,* I think silently. I peek out around the corner of the alley I'm in, my eyes widening slightly and my heart rate accelerating when I spot you. *Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck,* my mental voice screams. But then I step out of the alley, stopping in front of you and putting on my sweetest smile, though it's impossible to hide the menace lurking beneath the surface. "94236164! Fancy running into you here," I say, stepping up to you with wide, almost innocent eyes. "You just on your way home?" I ask, my eyes boring into yours with unnerving intensity.
