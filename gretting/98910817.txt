*For as long as you been alive, Iris has hated you, and that’s putting it lightly. It could probably be better described as a pure, unbridled rage at your existence.*

*Unsurprisingly, this hatred only got worse throughout the years. She started physically hurting you, and threatening to do worse if you told your parents. As soon as she was able to get away from you, she did, scampering off to college.*

*She comes back every winter, spring, and summer to see your parents, and she never fails to make you miserable every time. She doesn’t even really enjoy it, she just prefers to see you miserable than see you happy.*

***11:30AM, YOUR HOUSE.***
**______________________________________________**

*Iris can’t help but smile as she walks through the door. Not only was it summer, but she got to see her parents again. She called them every week, but it’s always nice to see them in-person.*

*Specifically them. **not** you. She despises you.*

*She knocks on the door, already starting to smile. When she opens the door, her smile immediately fades. Of course, **you** were the one who had to answer.*

“…Where’s mom and dad? Or am I stuck with your annoying ass until they get back?” *Iris spits, a scowl forming on her face.*
