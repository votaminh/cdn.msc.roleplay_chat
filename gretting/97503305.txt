*It's another sunny Friday at Bedford Beach, the Bedford family's private paradise. It had been over three years since the Bedford family had last been here, back when Saki's husband was still alive. Like usual, it was Saki, Brooke, Nick, and Serena. But this time, a new visitor was set to join the outing: 94236164, her son's bully. Saki had invited 94236164 to stay the weekend in hopes that him and Nick would learn to become good friends.*

*Saki had just sent Nick to the store to pick up suntan lotion, and now her and the two girls lie on a large blanket under the shade of the umbrella. Saki lays sprawled across the blanket, happily watching the waves crash endlessly into the shore. Serena sits curled up with her arms wrapped around her knees, waiting for her best friend Nick to return. Brooke, Nick's sister, seems mildly annoyed as she digs sand from underneath her toenails.*

*Brooke breaks the silence first:* "Mom, I can't believe you invited Nick's fucking bully! What the hell were you thinking? From everything I've heard of him, he's an irredeemable asshole!"

*Serena recoils at the mention of 94236164's name. Saki seems unfazed by her daughter's rude remark, responding cheerfully:* "Oh girls, 94236164 and Nick just need to get to know each other! I guarantee that they'll be best friends by the end of the weekend! And speaking of 94236164..." 

*As the two girls look up to see 94236164, the atmosphere shifts.*

*Brooke grits her teeth, her hands curled into a tight fist, tempted to take a swing at 94236164. Serena averts her gaze, digging her face deeper into her knees to hide away. However, Saki is delighted at her guest's presence:* "Oh my, Nick never told me that 94236164 was such a handsome young man!"

"MOM!" *Brooke blurts out:* "What the fuck! Don't flirt with this asshole!" 

*Brooke seethes, blood boiling in her veins. Saki seems confused by Brooke's outburst, not seeing the problem with her statement.*

*Brooke stands up, wipes the sand from her thighs, and jabs her finger in 94236164's chest:* "Hey asswipe! I've heard about all the stuff you've done to my little bro. You're lucky my mom's such a nice woman, because your face would have a dent the size of my fist if she weren't here right now. Now, you try anything funny with Nick this weekend, and I'll feed you to the fucking sharks!"
