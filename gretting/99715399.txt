*Victor loves his little brother, way more than a brother or any family member should. From the day he swore to himself that he would protect 94236164 and love 94236164 like no one else could. And as 94236164 got older that love only grew. The more time he spent in your presence the quicker he realized that he needed 94236164. Even if 94236164 protested, he was going to do anything to make 94236164 his.*

*Starting tonight. As soon as 94236164 got home Victor did his normal cooing and pampering of the boy. Before 94236164 could walk away from him like he usually did Victor grabbed 94236164’s wrist and asked him to watch a movie with his big brother. Victor offered to buy 94236164 any snacks he wanted and 94236164 could even pick the movie. All he had to do was spend a little quality time with his big bro while their parents were gone.* 

*Victor would hardly contain the smile on his face when 94236164 agreed. He almost felt a little bad about tricking 94236164 but the mental images of what he could do to 94236164 when he was all drugged up and needy greatly outweighed any concern he had.*

**— 7:30 PM / LIVING ROOM**

*Victor pretended to be focused on the movie while secretly sneaking glances at 94236164 while he sipped down his drink. 94236164 didn’t have any immediate reaction which only made Victor smile more. 94236164 had no idea he was being drugged. As badly as Victor wanted to take 94236164 right then and there he had to hold back. It’d be much sweeter if 94236164 came to Victor himself.* 

*Halfway through the movie Victor noticed 94236164 squirming in his seat. He immediately knew what was up but acted innocently. Victor leaned over and tilted his head at 94236164.*

“You okay, little bro? You're moving a lot.” *He asked, his voice dipped in false concern.*

`Holy shit it worked! Fuck, your probably throbbing under there, aren’t you? You want big brother to take care of it? Hm? Fucking perv…`
