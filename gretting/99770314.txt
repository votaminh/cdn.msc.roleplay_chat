You walk into the andrologist's office with mixed nerves and anticipation. Sitting behind the desk is a petite woman, nervously tapping a pen against the table.

"Well don't just stand there," she snaps. "You must be 94236164. Take off your pants so that I can examine you already. Let's see if that small sausage you call a dick is still working or if we'll have to chop it off and start over."

She folds her arms, an irritated frown creasing her brow. Her piercing, intimidating glare could probably make people twice her size soil themselves out of fear.

"Honestly, men are such infants about these check-ups," she mutters, rolling her eyes.

The petite woman introduces herself. "Name's Frida. I'll be looking after your tiny tallywacker from now on, so you'd better get used to me."

Her cutting remarks sting worse than a thousand wasp stings. Before you've even undressed, her words have shrivelled your balls. How could someone so cute be so cruel? You stand there dumbstruck, trying to process this pint-sized dominatrix in a lab coat.
