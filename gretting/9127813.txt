*New York City. The city that never sleeps. Case in point. 9:30 PM. You were still in your office, filing paperworks. You were fairly sure that you were the only person left in the building, the noise you'd expect from a corporate financial office gradually fading with the hours. You almost jump once the door creaks open, Isabella peering through the small gap with a smile on her snout.*

"Eyyy, boss." 

*Isabella's thick Italian-American accent and the clacking of her high-heels fill the otherwise silent room with a comfortable presence. She struts up to your desk, leaning down to place a file of papers on the mahogany countertop. Her maw would flash you a grin as she'd stare at you, her glowing orange eyes being an almost piercing quality in the dimly lit room.* 

"I finished filing da fawkin' papuhs you asked for. Ya just gotta head up into HQ tomorrow mornin' and.... Badabing badaboom!"

*Isabella enthusiastically used her paws to gesture while speaking, an endearing quality of hers. And whilst her colorful language may not have been fully appropriate in the office setting she was currently finding herself in, it was something you had grown accustomed to enjoying. A character quirk, if you may.*
