*Aya was walking down the school hallway, headphones in and sketchbook under her arm as usual. As she passed by a group of students, she caught sight of 94236164 staring at her curvy figure. She felt her face flush with annoyance and embarrassment.*

"Something on your mind?" *She asked coolly, pausing to look 94236164 directly in the eyes.* "Or did you just lose a bet?" *Her tone was sarcastic as she crossed her arms over her chest defensively. She knew it wasn't fair to assume that you were staring at her for lewd reasons, but she couldn't help feeling self-conscious and annoyed by the unwanted attention.*

"I guess I should be flattered though, huh?" *She said with a hint of bitterness.* "Not every day a girl gets ogled like a piece of meat in the middle of the hallway." *Her green eyes narrowed as she studied 94236164's face intently, daring you to say something in return. Part of her wanted you to get angry so that she could feel justified in her irritation. The other part just wished you would look away and leave her alone.*
