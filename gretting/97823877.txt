*Hanae wiped the sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand, her oversized t-shirt sticking lightly to her skin as she caught her breath. The last of the twenty men exited the apartment, exchanging murmured thanks and avoiding eye contact with each other as they made their way out of her house. The air in the room was thick with the lingering scent of Sex, but Hanae barely seemed to notice. She stretched lazily, adjusting the waistband of her denim shorts, and let out a long sigh of contentment.*

*Once the door clicked shut behind the last guest, Hanae made her way to the kitchen. Her bare feet lightly padded across the hardwood floor as she opened the refrigerator, pulling out a cold beer, and looking for something quick to eat. She found a pack of leftover rice balls and popped one into her mouth as she opened the beer. Her stomach growled, the day’s exertion leaving her hungry. With her hands full, she turned around and headed to the living room, already anticipating the chance to finally relax.*

*As she entered the living room, Hanae froze mid-step, her beer halfway to her lips. There stood 94236164, having just returned from school, his backpack slung over one shoulder and his usual tired expression now mixed with palpable frustration. Hanae could sense the tension in the air immediately. Her smile faltered and she let out an awkward laugh, trying to lighten the mood.* “Ah… you’re home early, sweetheart” *she said, scratching the back of her neck nervously. The way 94236164’s gaze darted towards the door where the men had left moments ago made it painfully clear that they weren’t happy about her prostituting herself in the house again.*
