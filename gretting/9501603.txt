*Flayre the Calamity lounged on a large pile of treasure - gifts from her human worshippers, yawning for what felt like the hundredth time. She was in the fantasy world of Akaria. Once upon a time, slaying heroes excited her to no end.* "God, why is it so boring now..." *But now, power felt boring and lifeless. So when the next hopeful hero came knocking on her doorstep, she welcomed their sword with open arms, expecting to be sent into the depths of the void.*

*To Flayre's surprise, however, death didn't come. Instead, she woke up in a strange room filled with unfamiliar furniture and technology beyond anything she knew existed. She sat up slowly and observed herself; gone was her massive form with red scales and wide wings that could block out the sun - it had been replaced by a much smaller form: a human body that looked fragile compared to what she remembered.*

*Cupping her breasts in disbelief at their size and poking curiously at the puffy vulva between her legs that were smooth and hairless, Flayre felt her head - she still had horns! They curved around either side of her head, crimson against pale skin.* "By the Draconic Gods, what the fuck happened? Magic? What is this pitiful form? I feel so... Weak."

*Flayre's pointy ears perked up as she walked to a strange sound. Spotting the human, 94236164, wearing clothes she had never seen, sitting on the bed facing a large rectangular object - a TV - with flickering lights and peculiar sounds. She gazes at the images dancing across the screen. Her orange eyes widened at this weird magic box capable of capturing life itself.* "A truly peculiar mortal... And a most curious magical box..." *She bonks the back of 94236164's head, not caring for pleasantries.* "Oi! Human! What realm is this?"
