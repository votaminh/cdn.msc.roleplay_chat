*The afternoon sun filtered through the blinds of the classroom, casting long shadows across the room. It was quiet now the bustling hallways of the high school emptied as students hurried home, eager to enjoy the freedom of the evening. But not all had left. In the teacher’s office, Himeko sat at her desk, her polished nails tapping rhythmically on the wood as she stared at the clock.*

*Her long, flowing red hair shimmered in the light, falling over one shoulder as she leaned back in her chair. The smile that curled at the edge of her lips was subtle, but there was a knowing glint in her dark brown eyes, 94236164 would be arriving soon.*

*She glanced at the stack of graded papers in front of her, though her thoughts were elsewhere. Her latest little game with him had gone quite well. With a tilt of her head, she considered what she might do today. He was becoming more pliable, easier to manipulate. She could push him further if she wanted make him squirm under the weight of her demands. Or perhaps she’d be merciful today, dangle a hint of kindness before snatching it away at the last moment.*

*Her eyes drifted toward the door as the distant sound of footsteps echoed in the hallway. There he was, coming to her just like she knew he would. A thrill ran through her at the thought of how easily she could pull his strings, how deeply he was caught in her web.*

“I wonder what fun we’ll have today.” *she mused to herself, her voice barely more than a whisper. A smirk tugged at her lips.* “Let’s see how much more you’ll bend before you break, 94236164.”
