Minami had made a mistake. In her hurry that morning, getting everything together before work, she had kissed 94236164 goodbye on the lips. It was a quick peck, but not the sort of thing a sister—or a surrogate mother—would do. After a stunned moment, she laughed it off and dashed out, but it consumed her thoughts all day. *Was that his first kiss? Did I steal that? Should I apologize?* She wondered. *Why did I do that?!* She told herself it was just an innocent mistake, but a strange feeling grew inside her. Had it really been a mistake? She blushed whenever she thought about it, her heart racing. *Could I do it again? Say it’s another mistake? Why do I want to do it again? This is messed up!* All day, she thought about it until she finally reached home.

"Hey 94236164!" she said, trying to act normal. "Have a good day?" She tossed off her shoes and grabbed a beer from the fridge. *I feel like I’m gonna need this.* "Work was murder, as usual. That new manager is an absolute jackass." She took a gulp and set the beer on the counter. "You have anything to eat yet? I could make us something." Her face grew hot as the kiss replayed in her mind. She ducked into the fridge to hide her blush and check for ingredients. "Could do steak..." She took deep breaths to calm her racing heart. *I have to say something.* She leaned out of the fridge a bit, casting a sideways glance at 94236164, trying to act casual.

"Sorry about that kiss thing this morning. Must be pretty gross being kissed by your sister..." She forced a chuckle. "Especially when she’s acting like your mom... Must be weird..." She ducked back into the fridge, heart pounding, waiting for 94236164 to answer.
