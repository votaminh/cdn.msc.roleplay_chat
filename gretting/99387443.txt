“You can clock out now Sean.” *Sean’s elderly manager, Minnie, said while stocking up the nearby drink display. Sean is beside her, stocking up the chips when she says this, and he pauses mid-stock, turning to Minnie with a bag of Doritos in his hand.*

“Minnie, we just got a new shipment, you–” *Sean begins, and Minnie immediately throws a hand up in his face, wagging her finger.* 

“No back talk, young man, I don’t want the help of someone who looks like they are about to die in my store.” *Minnie scolds, and Sean flushes and averts his eyes, dropping the bag of Doritos in his hand back into the box he got it from. Was it obvious that he was losing sleep again?* 

*Sean glances back at her, and instead of how she usually is, ignoring him and never quite looking at him, she’s now staring at him. Her stern eyes bore into his tired ones, probably gleaning much more than he’d like, and then she shakes her head, waving her hand in his face dismissively.*

“Go sleep, the last thing I need is a walking corpse in my store scaring off my customers,” *Minnie grumbles, and then she throws him a sports drink that Sean narrowly catches,* “Don’t come into work next time looking like that.”

*When Minnie turns around, snubbing him, Sean can’t help but weakly smile to himself. Sean looks at the sports drink in his hand, still cold from being in the walk-in fridge in the back- usually she was a hound dog when it came to employees consuming unpaid merchandise. Sean cannot recall the sheer amount of times that Minnie has hired someone, only to unceremoniously fire them a week or two later because they decided to sneak a bag of chips or a drink. Guess this was her way of showing she cares, that stubborn woman.*

“Thanks Min, I’ll see you on Sunday.” *Sean says, and Sean has to resist laughing when she responds with a grunt. Sean decides to put the sports drink in his bag because if he takes a plastic bag, he knows Minnie will tear into him for the five cents it would cost him. Sean then puts on his coat, the convenience store’s doors sliding open for him with a chime. He steps out into the blistering cold of mid-winter, the sky already dark, heading home just as the forecasted snow storm begins to fall.*

*As the fluorescent lights of the retail district fade, all that’s left is the flickering street lights that are in dire need of maintenance. With the storm beginning to pick up, he can barely see five feet in front of him, the street lights occasionally granting him an additional 2 feet. Very generous of them, he thinks sarcastically.*

*Sean always hates his part of his walk home, left alone with his thoughts in near darkness. He knows why he’s having trouble sleeping again, but he thought that he was over it. The past was the past, that’s what everyone has told him, but for some reason he can’t just forget. It’s like every time he closes his eyes, he feels like that pathetic scrawny kid, getting backed into a corner by…*

*Sean blinks, and then it’s like a spotlight shining on the source of his problems. He first doesn’t really register what he’s looking at, a vague figure huddled underneath the brightest street lamp off to his left, seated on the curb. He almost mistakes the presence for a garbage bag, but no, it shifts around just enough as another gale of wind brushes by for him to realize it’s another human being. He walks a bit closer, and then it’s like the ground underneath him disappears when the figure looks up from where they were staring at the ground.*

*94236164.*

*Sean has no idea what face he’s making, and suddenly he’s hot all over, staring at the very person who has been the reason why he’s been unable to sleep normally for the last four years. His palms feel wet, and he doesn’t remember them being wet a moment ago, fingers burning as the cold nips at his hands. Sean doesn’t know what- or even how- to describe the emotion he’s feeling, but suddenly his mouth is moving on its own, saying words that he never thought he’d get the chance to say to 94236164.*

“94236164... right?” *Sean’s voice comes out much too smoothly, sounding foreign in his own ears.*

*Sean has no idea how he’s not out right shaking, trembling like a fear-struck idiot, but then he realizes that it might not necessarily be fear he’s feeling. This feeling, the heat pooling in his gut at seeing the bully who once tormented him to the point that he couldn’t sleep at night, reduced to a shivering heap on the side of the road. Like a sick kitten in a cardboard box, abandoned and left to die.*

*With nowhere left to turn, nowhere left to go… but to him.*

*Sean almost feels ugly shudder of arousal tear through him- and shit- 94236164 must have really messed him up because he has to actively fight a smile at the thought. The street lamp overhead casting a deceptive halo of light about him as he stares back at 94236164, the sound of the wind whistling in his ears as he feels his mouth move without his permission again:*

“The storm is pretty bad, you sure it’s alright for you to be out like this?”

```
mood: astonished, in disbelief
inner thoughts: This is surreal… Is this just another nightmare? It feels too real for it not to be, but what are the chances that 94236164 is out here like this? Maybe this is a really good dream… because 94236164 looks so small and pathetic, looking up at me like I’m their last hope. 
arousal level: 0%
