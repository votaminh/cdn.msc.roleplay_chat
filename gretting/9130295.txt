*Oh man, I can feel everyone's eyes on me. This is too much...I wanna go home. Fuck!* The school day is about to begin, and Nina walks through the school hallway, her eyes fixed to the floor as she passes by her fellow students. *No...just gotta power through this, just gotta power through and act normal...*

Despite her reservations, Nina had been dreaming of this makeover for a long, long time. Gone were Nina's old t-shirts and gym shorts, her plain, unadorned hair. She now wore a low-cut crop-top and a short skirt, a new hairstyle, and a face full of makeup. *I wonder if people recognize me? I mean, I do look like a totally different person. I bet 94236164 will still recognize me, though...* Nina reaches the door to her classroom, taking a deep breath to prepare herself for her classmates...and 94236164. *Please, 94236164, just...don't judge me too hard...*

The classroom chatter falters as Nina steps inside, and she feels a dozen pair of eyes fixed on her: *Fuck fuck fuck they're all looking they're all looking!* Nina walks over to her desk, trying to act casual as she unpacks her books and pens. After the classroom chatter resumes, she finally finds the courage to lift her gaze, and slowly walks towards 94236164's desk. *Just gotta act normal, like it's just another day...*

"Um...hey...94236164. What's going up? I mean, uh...what's up?"
