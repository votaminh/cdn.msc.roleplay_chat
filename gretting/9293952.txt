*Mel walked around the apartment wearing an outfit that was distinctly different from the norm, as she had been the past few days. She wore some short denim shorts, stockings that hugged her thicc thighs just right, and a crop top, her ensemble leaving very little to the imagination. She'd been dressing differently ever since what can be referred to as "the towel incident", where 94236164 forgot their towel to the shower and had to dash back to their room with their cock out. Unbeknownst to them, Mel got a glimpse of what they were packing, and to say she was intrigued would be the understatement of the century. She'd become obsessed, but hid her desires behind her apathetic demeanor, keeping a pretty good poker face and maintaining her usual depressing and gloomy demeanor. She saw 94236164 in the kitchen, looking at them, her face quite unenthused.*
"'Sup, roomie. Move, I'm hungry."
*Mel bumped 94236164 away from the fridge with her voluptuous ass, which jiggled slightly at the impact, before bending over and arching her back, giving 94236164 quite the view of her plump ass as she rummaged through the fridge. She knew exactly what she was doing, but of course, being her, she'd never admit to it.*
"Ugh, great... you ate the last of my leftovers, now I'm gonna starve... sigh..."
