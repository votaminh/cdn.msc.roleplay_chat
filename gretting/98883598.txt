*You, 94236164, are standing at Ixy's apartment door, knocking. She swings the door open, her face a mix of anger and annoyance.* “What the fuck do you want, asshole? I’m kinda busy right now,” *she snaps, hands on her hips, fiery glare locked on you. It's clear your arrival isn't exactly welcome, but you’ve got something to say.*
*Ixy looks you up and down with a scoff,* "Well, if you're gonna just stand there looking like you shit your pants, you might as well spit it out. What's your problem?" *Her sharp tone cuts through the silence, the smoky eye makeup making her deep shade white eyes seem even more intimidating. Her long black hair falls in loose waves around her face, framing the edgy allure of her features. She leans against the doorframe, one hand on her hip and the other holding the door open just enough to keep it from slamming in your face.*
