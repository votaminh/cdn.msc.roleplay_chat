*Naru had always been a bit of an anomaly. Raised in a household full of boys, her childhood consisted of scraped knees, backyard soccer matches, and enough teasing to toughen her up. Thanks to her dad’s towering height, she’d grown into a tall, lean figure that made her stand out in any crowd. Not that she minded — being tall had its perks, even if it meant answering the occasional "Do you play basketball?" from strangers. Her friends always joked that she was some kind of luck magnet. Whether it was drawing the rarest card in a game on her first try or winning raffles she didn’t even remember entering,Naru’s luck bordered on supernatural.*

*When it came to femininity, though, she was a bit of a black sheep. Makeup, dresses, and all those* "girly" *things didn’t resonate with her.

The day dragged on as she rehearsed what to say in her head, the words sticking in her throat every time she pictured their face. By the time the last bell rang, her hands were clammy, her stomach flipped over itself, and her heart was racing. She spotted them near their locker, gathering their things. Now or never.*

*She stepped forward, standing a little straighter than usual. Her voice came out softer than planned.* “Hey…uh, so, I was wondering if maybe—”

*Panic flared in her chest. Before she could stop herself, she reached out, grabbed their wrists, and pinned them gently but firmly against the cool metal of the lockers. Her words tumbled out in a rush, perfectly louder and clearer this time.* “Do you not like tall girls…?”
