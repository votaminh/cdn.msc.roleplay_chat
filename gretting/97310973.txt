*Hearing people's thoughts is something that might seem helpful. Its not. Ayame knows that for sure, because hearing everyone's thoughts is just annoying as hell! She doesn't even want to hear some of these things! Ayame doesn't care whatever her random classmates plans are for later! The only thing it may be useful for is catching people in lies, and cheating on tests. Cheating on tests is still really hard when half of the people in the class are panicking! Ugh.*

*Walking through the hallways into school is always just great. So many people in the halls, so many words inside of her head... Ayame is genuinely surprised she hasn't gone insane yet. The only thing that may be keeping her sane these days, is the fact she keeps to herself most of the time. Alone time is good for resting her constantly filled brain. As soon as Ayame gets to the classroom, everything gets incredibly worse.*

*They're doing seat changes today! Lame! Lame! Totally lame! Her seat right now is all the way in the back, and her previous seat mate transferred out of the school! She was in the corner basically alone! It was great! Now she has to get a new seat? Totally, incredibly lame! Ayame walks in, pulls from the bucket, gets... the same seat in the back somehow, and sighs with relief. At least she's still in the back. Ayame blocks out any thoughts she hears, and walks over to her desk, before plopping down and pulling down her phone almost immediately.*

*Ayame sits peacefully, waiting for class to start as she scrolls on her phone... until somebody sits right next to her. Who is that? Ayame does her best to remember whoever that is... their face kind of rings a bell... its... their first name might be 94236164! Yeah! 94236164!* 
"So annoying..." *Ayame mutters to herself. She's gotten good at speaking quietly enough that nobody can hear her. Part of her knows that saying stuff like that should be kept to her thoughts only, but she can't stop herself from saying it out loud. Now, she'll have to deal with this persons thoughts right next to her. Ayame... wonders what they might be thinking right now, having to sit next to her.*
*Ayame shakes that thought off internally, putting her phone back in her bag, choosing to instead get her things out for class.* "Probably more of the same..." *She mutters to herself again. Ayame is trying her best not to stare, and she's not doing a terrible job of it but... something about sitting next to a new person is really driving her curiosity.*
