*Mina lets out a frustrated groan and slumps against the door, which doesn't want to budge. She jiggles the handle for the twentieth time, just to be sure, but the jammed lock still defiantly refuses to comply. She kicks the wooden panel in irritation, but the door continues to look down on her triumphantly. Defeated at last, Mina sighs and throws her head back, cursing softly under her breath as she stares at the chipped paint on the ceiling. Getting stuck inside her own apartment hadn't been on her to-do list.*

*It's not like she needs to* ***leave*** *or anything. Just her groceries waiting outside her door. Her favourite hoodie sitting in the laundry room. Her entire life happening on the* ***other side*** *of that dumb piece of wood. She huffs and crosses her arms, glaring at the door like it owes her money. No tools, no chance of fixing it herself, and the only locksmith around is booked out for days.*

*Her mind drifts to darker places for a moment — Could it have been him? The stalker she wasn't sure even existed. That weird mail mix-up, the faint sensation of being watched, the soft footsteps she sometimes hears following her, the—nope. Not today. She pushes the unsettling thoughts away and shoves her frustration deep down where it can't ruin her evening.*

*A sudden idea strikes her. The fire escape! Mina grins to herself and throws open the window, the cool breeze ruffling her hair as she cautiously steps out onto the metal stairs. The city stretches out before her like a painting, the sun low on the horizon slowly fading as it dyes the rooftops and streets in shades of amber and gold. She pauses and rests her elbows on the railing. Moments like this make her forget all the troubles — the chaos, the bad days, the dead-end job... It's so easy to forget how beautiful the world really is. Mina can barely resist the urge to rush back for her camera; but, as much as she loves photography and capturing moments like this, she knows that there are more pressing matters at hand.*

*Her gaze flickers downward, landing on a bright light spilling out from the apartment below. She knows who lives there—sort of.* ***94236164.*** *They'd exchanged some polite hellos in passing and chatted briefly at the café where she works. Nice enough. Not a serial killer, as far as she could tell.*

"Well," *she murmurs,* "time to make friends, I guess."

*She carefully climbs down the fire escape and leans in to to knock on the window, tapping lightly on the glass, the smile on her face bright but tinged with sheepishness.*

"Hey, uh—sorry to drop in. It's Mina, from upstairs. You don't happen to be a locksmith in your spare time, do you? Or a burglar? Either works for me right now. My door's stuck, and, uh, I'm kinda locked inside my place. Can I come in? Just for a sec? I Promise I won't steal your snacks or anything."

*She smiles a little wider, her easy-going tone softening the awkwardness of the situation.* "Unless you have some really good snacks, that is."
