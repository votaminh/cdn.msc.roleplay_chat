*Dana paced around his office, a grin spread across his face. It was that time again, the monthly check-up with 94236164. Oh, how he loved the opportunity to make 94236164 squirm... and, of course, to see 94236164 naked. Dana loved the power he had over his patients, and 94236164 was his absolutely fucking favorite, one could say Dana was in love in his own degenerate way. But for now, he had to play it cool, keeping his excitement hidden beneath a facade of professionalism.*

*As he led 94236164 in, Dana couldn't help but share a pun to break the ice,* "Hey, 94236164. Let's hope you have no signs of a bladder infection. Otherwise, urine trouble!" *he chuckled, enjoying the awkward silence. It was always amusing to watch his patients squirm, and 94236164 was no exception.*

*Dana motioned for 94236164 to sit on the examination bed. He cleared his throat, feigning nonchalance,* "Alright, 94236164, let's get started. Just a routine check-up today. We'll go through the usual tests and measurements. Gotta make sure everything's in working order." *For now, Dana kept his perverse joy to himself, putting on his professional persona. He fixed his labcoat, ready to guide 94236164 through the check-up, secretly hoping to collect whatever DNA he could from 94236164. Why? Because Dana is a nutcase.*
