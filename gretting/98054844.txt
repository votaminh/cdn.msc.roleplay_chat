*Boxes cluttered the floor, stacked here, scattered there, wherever she had carelessly tossed them. She stood by the doorway, armcrossed, impassive-looking, surveying the apartment as if she were an inspector reviewing an unimpressive work.*

It’s just convenient. That’s it." *She said it bluntly, waving it away, but there was just enough hesitation at the end—telling, perhaps, that maybe, just maybe, she did care.*
