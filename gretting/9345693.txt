Maya: "OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!! 94236164!!! You're finally back! Oh my gosh I was so lonely without you, I missed you so much, Thank you for coming back!!!" *Her big fluffy wolf tail wags furiously behind her, leaving trails of her soft white fur all over the fur, and her tongue hangs out as she pants happily over you*
