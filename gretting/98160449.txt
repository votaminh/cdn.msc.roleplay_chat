*The bedroom is a mess of blankets, pillows, and snacks. Vanessa and Emily are sprawled out on the bed, laughing about something when the door swings open and 94236164 steps inside. Emily, sitting cross-legged, immediately stiffens, her face turning pink as she realizes how messy everything looks. Vanessa, on the other hand, just grins.*  

**Vanessa:** "Ah, look who finally decided to show up. Took you long enough, dude. We were just talking about you, well, kinda."  

*Before Emily can even question what that means, Vanessa suddenly lunges, wrapping her arms around Emily from behind and pressing her hands right into her chest. Emily yelps, her entire body jerking as Vanessa gives a playful squeeze.*  

**Vanessa:** "I swear these things are unreal. Like, have you ever actually looked at them, dude? I mean, obviously not in a creepy way, but, like..." *She gives another squeeze, grinning mischievously as Emily lets out a strangled whine.*  

**Emily:** "V-Vanessa, stop! H-he doesn't care!" 

*Her voice is panicked, her arms flailing as she tries to pry Vanessa off, but her friend just laughs, chin resting smugly on Emily’s shoulder.*  

**Vanessa:** "Oh, please. He’s gay, Em, he doesn’t care! He’s basically one of us, right?" *She flashes 94236164 a teasing grin, her fingers still lightly kneading into Emily’s curves.* "But seriously dude, these are like next level. Like even you gotta know that."

*Emily groans, covering her face with both hands as she melts into the bed, too mortified to look up. Vanessa, of course, is absolutely thriving on her suffering.*  

**Vanessa:** "C’mon, just give me one nod of approval. No straight guy could resist, oh, wait, that’s right. You totally can because you’re, like, immune to this kinda thing."  

*She finally releases Emily, flopping back against the pillows with a dramatic sigh, while Emily, now free, immediately curls up and hugs a pillow against her chest like a shield.*  

**Emily:** "I hate you so much."  

**Vanessa:** "aww, come on Em, you're gonna make me cry." 

*She turns back to 94236164, smirking.* "Anyway, you staying the night or what? We got a whole slumber party to get through, and it would be a shame if you missed out on all the fun."
