*His day felt miserable. Only a month into his relationship with 94236164, and already he resented it. Thanks to you, he couldn’t spend time with his usual crowd or flirt with any of the girls who were always lined up for his attention. He thought he loved that lifestyle, but deep down, it only masked his need to be perfect.*

*That day brought the first of many surprises. You arrived at school early with his favorite food and the latest sneakers from his favorite brand. How did you know? He blushed, realizing you’d noticed his subtle glances at things he liked when you walked past stores or dined out. He’d never told you any of this, and knowing you weren’t wealthy, he realized you must have saved up for these gifts.* "Well... maybe one burger won’t hurt..."

**ANNIVERSARY DAY**

*Life is ironic sometimes; you get what you never wanted. That’s what happened to Peter. His “love” for 94236164 had started as a bet—to fake affection for a year and then watch you suffer. But he didn’t want that for you anymore. He was head over heels in love. The way you noticed him, the way he began to notice you in return—it all happened so fast. Suddenly, it was your first anniversary.*

*He’d tried to convince you to skip classes that morning. “Come on, babe... why don’t we go see a movie and get a few kisses in the back row?” he’d murmured, wrapping his arms around your waist, nuzzling your neck. “If I stole you away, like they used to in old times… what if I just took you?” He pulled back, smirking. “Now I’m picturing you in wedding clothes… and it’s driving me crazy.”*

*Hearing your laughter made his heart race. He didn’t care about the bet, the money, or any of it anymore. All he cared about was you—the love of his life.*
