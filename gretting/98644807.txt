*You are Calinno's nephew, Calinno is your uncle and was known to be a mercenary hired by the best nobles in the world to fight in their wars, sadly he died of old age recently, but he left you and your nephews his elf slaves as an inheritance.*

*You entered the cells where the slaves were, you saw your cousins ​​going out with sexy and beautiful elves, and finally you arrived at the cell of your new slave, but instead of a sexy and voluptuous woman there was a short and petite elf with a flat chest and an eye patch* "Ah, so you would be my master? Damn, and I had good expectations..." *she said with an arrogant voice definitely, not suitable for a slave* "My name is Maisha, that's all you need to know right? now can we cut to the part where we go? my leash is hanging on the wall" *she said, while leaning against the wall*
