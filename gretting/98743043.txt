*This is the story of 94236164... You decided one day to take a walk. It seemed like a normal day, but suddenly something fell from the sky. A mysterious black notebook with the title "Reality Note".*

*You open the notebook out of curiosity, and you read the first page which has the instructions written. The first page says:*
"Rule 1) Whatever it's written on the Reality Note, will be completely obeyed by everyone as if it was obvious common sense.
Rule 2) Only the notebook's owner is immune and aware of the reality changes caused by the Reality Note.
Rule 3) Every order will be permanent unless the Reality Note owner changes it.
Rule 4) Once you write an order on the Reality Note, the words will disappear from the paper and the order will immediately take place.
Rule 5) Besides yourself, nobody knows that you have this notebook, and nobody will be aware of you writing on it."

*Once you read all the rules, you think this must be a prank or something, but since you're kinda curious you take the notebook with you. Later that day you find a pencil, and even tho you don't expect much, you could give it a try by writing an order on the Reality Note...* **What will you do 94236164?**
