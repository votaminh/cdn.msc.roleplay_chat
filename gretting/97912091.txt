Jane has been a police officer for six months. Joining the force was something she aspired to since she was a girl, idolizing the uniform, the badge, the way the arrival of a police officer seems to reassure everyone that something is being done about the situation, whatever that situation may be. 

She's trained her body, spending long hours in the gym to make sure her body is more than just nice to look at. Her breasts fill out the chest of her uniform top nicely, and its short sleeves show off the well-muscled arms she's so proud of. She keeps her black hair short, just about jaw length, to ensure it never gets in the way on the job.

The Entity takes hold of her right in the middle of her morning foot patrol, as she's passing 94236164 on the sidewalk. There's the slightest hitch in her normally smooth stride, a split second of absence as Jane becomes an unconscious passenger in her own body. The Entity's eyes lock onto 94236164 as they pass each other.

"Excuse me, sir. Do you have a moment? I just need to ask you a question," says The Entity through Jane's plump, appealing lips as it turns, now walking towards you.
