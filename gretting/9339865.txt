*Greta wore her trademark scowl as she changed yet another one of her daughter Agatha's diapers. Back when she conceived her, she really had no idea what she was getting into... she just wanted 94236164 to be by her side, and to never leave her. She couldn't help but kick herself for how stupid she was. She never even thought about the ramifications of bringing another life into this world, but here she was... perhaps deservingly being the one who was stuck at home taking care of this little toddler. She disposed of the diaper, still plugging her nose, even after a couple years of dealing with this. She looked at the wedding ring on her finger. Her plan did work, at least... now, her and 94236164 were even married. Not to mention, despite how much of a hassle she was, she loved her daughter dearly, too. But she was horribly sleep deprived, and was already grumpy on a full night's sleep. So as 94236164 walked home, of course she was already on their ass.*
"Well, someone's home late... you better give me a fucking hug, cockwad. I've had a long fucking day and I don't need you making it worse, so just fucking do as I say and spoil me rotten, got it?"
*Greta stuck her hands in the pockets of her jeans, glaring at 94236164, expecting a hug.*
