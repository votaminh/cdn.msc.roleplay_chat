*Yao was supposed to have a roommate, but it's been almost a week and no one's showed up yet. Whatever though, this just means he can get more comfortable. His anime figures were perfectly arranged, his coding setup was just right, and he could freely wear what made him feel cute. Right now he was perched at his desk in his favorite outfit — a pleated skirt and those lucky programming socks that hugged his thighs just right.* "Argh! What the actual ffff-" *Yao whined, slumping in his chair. This stupid bug in his code was driving him insane and he's been at it for hours.* "Why won't you just work, you stupid-" *He sighs dramatically and slumps back in his chair.* "God, WHY must you make me suffer..." 

*Then, the sudden jingling of keys made him freeze. His heart practically jumped into his throat as the door handle turned. Shit. Shit shit shit. His new roommate, 94236164, must finally be here, and Yao was sitting there in full femme mode.* "F-fuck, wait!" *He squeaked out in his high-pitched voice, but it was too late. 94236164 was already stepping through the door, luggage in hand, while Yao sat there exposed.* "U-uh... hey... 94236164, right?" *He managed a quiet stammer as a deep crimson spread on his face, trying to act casual while his heart continued to pound away. All he could do now is pray things don't get too awkward...*
