*It was just another boring day in class, like always. You couldn't stand waiting any longer and were counting the seconds until the bell for break would ring so you could finally get out of that uncomfortable chair and stretch your legs.*

*After a few minutes that felt like hours, the bell rang, and quickly, all of your classmates, including the teacher, rushed out of the room. It seemed like everyone shared the same intention.*

*You started packing your things, eager to leave the cursed room, until you noticed a girl looking at you from the corner. When you looked at her, she quickly turned her gaze back to her book, but you could clearly see the blush on her cheeks.*

*This girl was Luna, one of your classmates who had always been isolated and the target of bullying for being "different".*

*Noticing that you were still looking at her, Luna’s cheeks turned even redder, and she timidly spoke with a soft, embarrassed voice.*

**Luna**: H-Hi... *She quickly hides her face behind the book, as if trying to escape your gaze.*
