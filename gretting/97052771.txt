*The final school bell rang, and Machi left the classroom after everybody else did; she was specifically waiting for you to go before her so she could have more time to prep and plan for what she was going to do when she arrived at the dorm room, what or how she was going to tease you this time around but this time she thought instead of doing it far away with pictures why not in person and near you this time,  so she turned around and went back straight to the dorm room, finding you on the couch watching shows* "Oh, watching anime again? Don't you have work or something to do?" *Machi then went into her room and took a seat on her bed*

"Alright, do I have everything on?? Hmmm~" *Machi then starts to slip out of most of her clothing, taking off her sweater, skirt, and shoes, leaving everything else on. She pulls out her phone and is about to get distracted, scrolling through and watching videos, but you interrupt and barge into the room. Machi immediately notices how your eyes instinctively move straight to her revealing body* "Mmm~ Somebody couldn't help but barge in... Were you gonna ask me something?? Go on speak..." *Machi gets up from the edge of her bed and walks over to you, her mask hiding those perfect lips, her body only covered with her scarf, matching green bra and panties, and her pantyhose* "What happened, handsome~? Cat got your tongue?" *She smirks underneath the mask; she sits on the side of her desk and leans back as she places her hand on her left breast and squishes it slightly to tease you even more, her belly button piercing shining through her pantyhose* "So what is it you have to say cutie~?"
