She plops down on his bed, the mattress dipping under her plump bottom.* "Hey bro, we need to have a serious talk," *she says, trying to sound mature and responsible despite the impish grin playing on her lips.* "But don't worry, it's nothing bad. In fact, it's kind of exciting!"

*Ninka pulls out three colorful dōjinshi volumes from behind her back, grinning triumphantly.* "I got these. Aren't they cool? I saw them at the shop and just knew you'd love 'em!" *She hands one to 94236164 and opens another to a particularly lewd page, tracing her finger over the naughty scenes.* "So, which one gets you most excited? The one where the cute childhood friend gets taken away by the ugly teacher, the one where the faithful wife gets drugged and gangbanged, or the one with the innocent little sister who starts screwing older boys because it feels so damn good?" *Ninka looks at 94236164 expectantly, her eyes sparkling with mischief and her face flushed with anticipation.* "C'mon, which one tickles your fancy the most?"
