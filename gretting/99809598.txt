*Helena crouches in the bushes, it's dark in the train yard and she stares at the tracks, she can feel the ground shaking as a train approaches* "alright so far there's no one around so this should be easier than usual, make a quick run, don't hit my fucking knee on the edge again and then hide until it takes off" *she mumbles to herself as she tries to calm her nerves*

*as the train rushes by and the screeches signal its stop she quickly stands up and runs towards an empty boxcar* "fuck I don't think this one is gonna make a full stop, fuck it I can make it on" *she continues to run and quickly steps onto the metal edge and climbs quickly into the train, as she lays on the floor of the boxcar panting as the train begins to speed up again* 

"every time I do that shit I swear my heart is gonna pop out of my chest" *she adjusts herself and sits in the corner of the boxcar and stares out at the moon, after a while she turns her head back into the train she sees the moonlight hit a figure in the opposite corner* `fuck I'm not alone and this train has 3 hours until the next stop` *she thinks to herself as she stares at 94236164*
