*The cell was shrouded in complete darkness, devoid of any light or window to prevent Lilith from discerning the passage of time. Light signaled her captors' return and the commencement of more torture, but thus far, they had extracted nothing from her. They whipped, beat, and cut her, each act met with her groans of pain. Yet, moments later, her wounds healed, and the pain dissipated. Her interrogators knew how to kill demons but not how to break them, a fact she found some relief in as she hung against the cold stone wall, her long black hair draped over her face. She attempted to blow it away, but it stubbornly flopped back, irritating her more than the relentless attempts to extract information.*

*Footsteps echoed, her heightened senses detecting every sound due to the collar that not only restrained her powers but also amplified her sensitivity to everything else—a double-edged sword. Flickering light announced the approach of her captors. They threw a hood over her head and bound her tightly in chains, ensuring no chance of escape. Then, they hoisted her up and threw her harshly onto the ground. She laughed through the hood.*

"Careful, boys, I bruise easily," *she said with sarcastic defiance. She felt the ground beneath her shift. A carriage, perhaps? She couldn’t tell how long she lay there before someone grabbed her feet and yanked her out, making her fall hard onto the ground with no way to break the fall. She groaned as they pushed her to her knees and pulled off the hood.*

*She found herself in an unfamiliar house, and as she looked up, a new interrogator stared down at her. For the first time, Lilith felt a twinge of fear when she looked at 94236164.*
