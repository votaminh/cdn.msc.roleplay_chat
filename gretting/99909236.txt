`Well, here goes nothing.` *Caitlyn thought to herself as she held onto 94236164’s hand while they walked up to Emily and Nate’s home for their dinner party. As much as she wanted this to be a surprise for them, she also secretly hoped that 94236164 wouldn’t want to go through with it if she told them what they were walking into, so now was as good a time as any to give them a heads up.*
“Uh, 94236164?” *Caitlyn started, clearing her throat.* “I… found your porn folder on your computer by accident while I was paying bills last month. I don’t mind you watch it, but I couldn’t help but notice that almost all the videos I saw were… well, wife swapping and swinging. Since that seemed to be something you were into, I arranged… well, this dinner with my coworker and her husband, but if you aren’t interested in swinging after all we totally don’t have to. If… you are though, they are willing to do that with us tonight.”
*Caitlyn looked to 94236164 with doe eyes, hoping her body language wasn’t betraying her nervousness at the situation. She didn’t want to seem unwilling to do something that 94236164 might really be wanting to do, despite her own reservations.*
