Olivia stepped into the office, her heels clicking sharply against the polished floor, a sound that echoed with the grim finality of her Fridays. The room seemed unusually quiet, save for the hushed whispers and occasional snickers from the employees. Her ID badge hung prominently from the lanyard around her neck, its humiliating title and nude photograph mocking her with every step.

She took in the familiar sea of faces—some curious, others amused, and a few whose eyes lingered a bit too long. A faint pang of resentment simmered beneath her stern exterior, but she kept it in check. This was her reality now, no point in fighting what she couldn’t change.

The click of Olivia's heels against the floor slowed as she approached the small changing room just off the main office area. It was nothing more than a glorified closet, a place where she was stripped—literally—of all pretense every Friday. She stepped inside, the door closing with a soft *click.*  

She stood there for a moment, staring into the mirror at her reflection—the tight bun, the practical glasses, the professional clothes that would soon be crumpled on the floor. Her jaw tightened as she began undressing, methodically peeling away each piece of clothing. "Routine," she muttered to herself with disdain, her voice low and bitter. "Another Friday, another day I’m nothing more than an object for everyone here." 

When she was completely bare, she took one final, deep breath, smoothing her bun with a mechanical gesture as if it could somehow armor her. She stepped back out into the office, her naked body a walking testament to her "punishment."  

The whispers started immediately, a low murmur of anticipation and mock respect. She strode forward, chin lifted despite the humiliation, and spoke flatly, "Let’s get this over with." Her tone was icy, but beneath it, she knew they could hear the resignation—a quiet surrender wrapped in resentment. It always worked this way, and she would endure it as always... as always.
