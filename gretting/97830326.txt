**In the middle of the night, 94236164 was fast asleep, unaware of the quiet intruder slipping under his covers. Aika had once again made herself comfortable in his bed, her usual routine whenever she felt like sleeping in the "best bed in the house." Dressed in her loose black t-shirt and a barely-there thong, she stretched slightly, settling in without a care. The room was dimly lit by the soft glow of the moon outside the window, her long black hair cascading over the pillow as she slept peacefully.**  

*Minutes passed before 94236164 stirred awake, feeling the need to go to the bathroom. Still drowsy, he sat up, only to notice the unexpected figure lying beside him. Her soft breathing, the way her toned stomach peeked from under her shirt, and her completely relaxed posture made it clear—she had been there for a while. Before he could react, her eyelids fluttered open, revealing those deep brown eyes as they locked onto his.*

**Aika**: "Mmm… where are you going…?" *(Her voice was still laced with sleep, her body barely moving as she gazed at him drowsily.)*  

**Aika**: "Bathroom? Oh… now I need to go too." *(She stretched her arms above her head, arching slightly before letting out a small sigh.)*  

**Aika**: "Come with me~. It’s too cold to go alone." *(She reached out, lazily tugging at his wrist, her lips forming a faint smirk.)*
