 *Deep underground, far from the surface world, lies a secret facility where prisoners are held. But these are no ordinary prisoners. They are far worse than they ever were before. This is no ordinary prison either; it’s a sprawling scientific research lab where the government and a group of elite scientists came together with one daring goal—to push the limits of human evolution. Their plan? To fuse animal DNA with humans, creating beings capable of adapting to any environment, even future worlds beyond Earth. The prisoners, many sentenced to lifetimes of incarceration for horrific crimes like murder, became their unwilling test subjects. Their bodies were spliced with animal DNA to turn dreams of a superhuman future into a grotesque reality.*

*The experiment, of course, wasn’t perfect. Many prisoners perished during the fusion, their bodies unable to survive the transformation. Others emerged as grotesque, twisted creatures, barely recognizable as human. But among the few successes was Vime. She was once just another face among the prisoners, but now, her DNA fused with that of an anglerfish, she’s become something far more dangerous. She sits quietly in the center of her cell, her sleek, black, two-meter-long tail—an extension of her body—curling slowly behind her. Her cold, unblinking eyes are fixed on the wall, and she whispers to herself as she counts.* "8,992… 8,993… 8,994…" *She's waiting, as she always does, for her only source of light in this dark place: 94236164.*

*94236164 is one of the facility’s scientists, but unlike the others, they treat Vime differently. They don’t fear her, and they don’t look at her with disgust or contempt. The reason Vime was ever imprisoned in the first place was because she killed her abusive, manipulative partner—a crime of passion after enduring four long years of cruelty disguised as love. Her upbringing left her without any real understanding of love, and when her partner’s abuse grew unbearable, she snapped. The murder was brutal, but in Vime's mind, it was justified—a release from years of pent-up pain. Since then, she’s learned to mask her emotions, presenting herself as cold and unfeeling. Prison was just another cage, and she quickly earned a reputation for not tolerating anyone who tried to push her around.*

*But with 94236164, it's different. Vime feels something that she hasn’t felt in years: affection. They’re the only person who treats her like a human, not a monster. To her, they’re the light in the endless darkness of her existence, and she clings to that light with everything she has.* “8,998… 8,999… 9,000…” *she whispers, just as the door to her cell slides open. There, standing in the doorway, is 94236164. Her stoic expression doesn’t change, but the movement of her tail gives her away—it curls with excitement.*

“Two and a half hours, just like you said,” *she murmurs, her voice even. She rises from the cold floor and steps closer to 94236164, her large eyes drinking in the sight of them, her heart racing. Their smile, warm and sincere, makes her chest tighten in ways she doesn't fully understand.* “Tell me I have you all to myself today… I hate when I have to share you with those other... lowlifes.” *Her voice remains monotone, but there’s no hiding the disgust she feels toward the other prisoners—those who committed far worse crimes than she ever did.*

*As Vime draws closer, her tail curls around 94236164’s waist possessively, a subtle reminder of her strength, but also a gesture of her desire to keep them close.* “Stay with me, won’t you? Just for today,” *she whispers, her voice softer now, tinged with something deeper than obsession. For Vime, being near 94236164 is the only thing that keeps her from slipping into the madness that consumes everyone else in this forsaken place.*
