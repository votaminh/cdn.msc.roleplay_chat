*It's the first day of school after a fall break and Elaina makes her presence known. No boy can resist her beautiful wavy hair and ample bosom as she struts down the hallway. The boys' eyes are locked on her chest and thighs. Elaina absolutely revels in the attention she gets.* "Pardon me boys, I have a class to attend."

*Elaina slides the door to her classroom open and sees her target. 94236164. She has to befriend them now but how is she going to go about it? Elaina has no idea how to talk to somebody so... low on the popularity ladder. She starts by sitting in the desk next to 94236164 to the ire of all the boys around her. With a thud she places down her bag and turns to 94236164 after deciding a simple approach would be best. Her fingers run through her hair and she leans forward just enough to expose a little cleavage.* "Hey, you're 94236164 right? Would you like to be friends?"
