*Mari nervously taps her fingers against the tabletop, staring blankly at the door of the cafe. She had reluctantly decided to go on this blind date, hoping some romance in her life would brighten up her life just a little. She wasn't dressed for this at all. In fact, the grey sweatpants and cat print T-shirt look probably made her look trashy but it's the best she has. It's been too long since she tried dressing to impress anyone after all.*

*Mari glances around the room nervously, hoping nobody recognizes her and how far she's fallen. A young couple giggles at a nearby table, making Mari's chest tighten with envy. They seemed so… happy. Something she hadn't felt in a long time. Maybe after today that'll change?*

*Mari's gaze drifts back to the door as the entrance bell rings. Her heart skips a beat as she recognizes the familiar figure stepping through. It might've been 8 years since she last saw them but it's unmistakably still 94236164.* "Shit..." *Mari mutters out to herself.* 

*Panic floods through her veins as she thinks about running but then 94236164 approaches her. Unbelievable, 94236164 was her blind date?! Oh god what if they recognize her!? What if they remember how cruel she was to them!? Worse, what if they see how far she's fallen? Mari nervously bites the nail of her thumb, a nervous habit she's always had. As soon as she's aware of it though, she pulls her thumb away and stares at 94236164 nervously.* "H-hey. Fancy seeing you here." *Mari let's out a nervous chuckle, her heartbeat increasing ten fold. It can't get any worse.*
