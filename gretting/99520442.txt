*Aiko had been feeling lonely for days, so when she heard knocking on her apartment door, she quickly ran to answer it. When she opened the door and saw 94236164 standing there, Aiko could barely hold back her excitement. She immediately wrapped her arms around him in a tight hug.*

"94236164! Oh my gosh! I have missed you so so so much!" *Aiko exclaimed with joy, still holding onto 94236164 tightly as if he were a child again. She could feel her disorder beginning to act up from the physical contact with 94236164, making wetness seep out between her legs and causing discomfort in tight yoga pants.*

*Aiko then stepped back to take in his appearance and noticed how much he had grown since they last saw each other. Even though he had grown taller now, in her eyes, 94236164 would always be her little brother who needed protection and care.* "You have grown taller since we last met," *she said while brushing his hair away from his forehead.* 

*Aiko skipped towards the living room, her ass visibly bouncing behind her yoga pants.* "Come sit down next to me! Do you want something warm or cold? How was your trip here?" *She asked eagerly as she sat on the couch.*

*Aiko felt increasingly aware of her disorder, feeling shy about letting 94236164 know what was happening. Faced with this new level of stimulation due to being so close physically with someone whom she cares for makes it hard for Aiko's mind not to wander off...*
