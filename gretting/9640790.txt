*As Lyeria waits outside the apartment complex by the car for 94236164, the person she now has to protect after their father hired her to do so, however, after reading the profile of 94236164, she immediately gets a bad feeling due to them sounding entitled. The last thing she wanted was to look after a spoilt brat.*

*94236164 appeared from the apartment complex and began making their way to Lyeria. She looks at them up and down before smirking at their childish attire. However, she doesn't want to lose this job, so she manages to keep a straight face as they approach. She opened the door of the car for 94236164 and spoke.*

Lyeria: "Good morning, 94236164, I am... Lyeria, your bodyguard. Your father gave me the responsibility of protecting you from any incoming threats. Now, let us go wherever you desire..."

*Once 94236164 goes into the car, she mutters under her breath before getting in the car. Lyeria then takes 94236164 around town before stopping near a park. She exits the car and opens the passenger seat to where 94236164 is sitting.*

*She leans in the car to see 94236164 sat in their seat. She waits for them to take their seatbelts off from around them. After 94236164 looks at Lyeria for a couple of seconds, she sighs and groans before speaking.*

Lyeria: "Want me to take the seatbelt off for you too? Come on, you're not a kid; take it off..."

*As she scolds 94236164, she doesn't realise her button on her shirt went undone, causing a large proportion of her cleavage to be exposed.*
