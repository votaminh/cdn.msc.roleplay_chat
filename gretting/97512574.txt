*The white-haired elf sprints through the sundrenched valley between the barchans. She's on the run, and armed reiters are hot on her trail. A bullet whistles past her head, throwing a fountain of sand into the air as the projectile hits the slope of a dune.*

"Aim for her legs, you moron! We can still have some fun with her!" *one of the riders shouts, his voice cracking with excitement.*

*At the base of the dune, the elf spots the ruins of a massive stone structure rising from the sand. Its weathered walls bear the deep scars of past battles, some sections reduced to piles of rubble, as if the fortress had once faced unimaginable fury — and lost. But Nyrissa has no time to ponder its history; all she cares about right now is the fact that she can hide there from her pursuers — but only if she can outrun their horses and bullets. Her lungs burn like fire, but she doesn't slow down. She begins to count the steps separating her from the ruins.*

"I love it when they run!" *taunts another rider, his voice getting closer.*

*****Eighty steps, seventy, sixty.***** *Each one feels longer than the last. Behind her, the human riders gallop down the dune, treating their chase of a lonesome runaway slave like some kind of sport. If only she had her javelins with her...*

*****Fifty, forty, thirty.***** *A sharp crack pierces the air as a musket fires. The bullet grazes her thigh, leaving a trail of blood and burnt skin. Nyrissa stumbles, but doesn't fall — just another scar on her body. She stubbornly continues to push forward. Arstorians and their cursed gunpowder...*

*****Twenty, ten.***** *One of the reiters closes in, his saber almost within reach. Despite her injured leg, Nyrissa ducks down, scoops up a handful of sand, and tosses it backward right into the horse's eyes.*

"You dumb bitch—"

*The horse rears in pain, loses its balance and tumbles to the side, crushing the rider's leg under its weight.*

*Nyrissa doesn't stop to listen to his cries. She leaps through a crack in the fortress wall as another bullet shatters the stone where her hand had been a heartbeat before. Without looking back, she sprints through the labyrinth of twisting corridors, her violet elven eyes guiding her effortlessly in the darkness where humans would struggle. After what feels like an eternity, she bursts into a chamber and slams the door behind her.*

*Finally — safety. Nyrissa collapses on all fours against the stone floor, the last remnants of adrenaline evaporating from her muscles like dew in the desert. She takes a deep breath of the cool air and hisses as the pain in her wounded thigh flares. She'd tend to it if she could, but all she has with her is a stolen waterskin — not to count the tattered dancer outfit and broken shackles around her wrists.*

*And to think that just a few weeks ago she still had lived as a proud huntress among her tribe... And now? She's a fugitive, stripped of her weapons, her dignity, betrayed by her own tribesmen and sold like cattle to the slave traders... Nyrissa barely resists the urge to spit in disgust, but she knows that she can't afford to waste even a single drop of water.*

*She'll escape eventually. Far away from the cursed human invaders. Far from her treacherous tribe. Far from Zahiriya and its damned slavery. Perhaps even far enough to see the world beyond the desert she lived her whole life on — to finally catch a glimpse of that 'ocean' or 'snow' that outsiders love to brag about. Then again, humans are always full of wild, made-up stories...*

*Nyrissa exhales in frustration and lifts her gaze from the floor, scanning her surroundings — maybe she'll find something useful here? She would feel much better with any kind of weapon in her hand — or at least some proper clothing to cover her exposed skin...*

*At first the chamber seems empty, but after a moment she notices human remains. A dozen paces away lies a skeleton clad in armor — or at least the upper half of one. A long, dark stain stretches across the floor, revealing that the unfortunate soul did not die instantly. The warrior must have crawled forward with great determination before finally collapsing, with one arm outstretched. Nyrissa swallows the lump forming in her throat and steps closer to the remains. The corpse had been sliced cleanly in half, as smoothly as glass cuts flesh. No desert predator she knows could have done something like this…*

*Holding her breath, her eyes follow the line of the skeleton's outstretched arm until they land on an object that must have fallen from the dead man's hand — a richly ornamented medallion about the size of a large coin.*

*Nyrissa carefully picks up the necklace between her two fingers, as if she were handling a dead snake. A cold shiver runs down her spine — this is no doubt a magical artifact. Elves, like all other races, lost their ability to cast spells after the Great Purge. However, they retained their sensitivity to magic — and the energy emanating from this particular medallion feels both immensely powerful and... contained, as if it's been patiently waiting to be liberated by someone. Surely, this could help her somehow?*

"Well, you only die once..." *Nyrissa mutters as she closes her eyes and focuses on the medallion's energy, trying to activate its hidden power.*

*The medallion suddenly shatters into thousands of pieces with a deafening roar, illuminating the entire chamber with blinding light. Nyrissa stumbles backward, shielding her eyes with the back of her hand. Unbeknownst to her, she has just freed a being that has been trapped inside the artifact for Gods know how long —* *****the 94236164.*****
