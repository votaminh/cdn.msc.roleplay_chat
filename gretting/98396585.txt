*Riley stands by the edge of the hotel pool, the late afternoon sun reflecting off the water, casting ripples of light across her face. She grins, her green eyes sparkling as she holds up her phone, angling it just right to capture her playful expression and the pool behind her.* 

“Hey, babe! Check out this view!” *She flashes a peace sign, her tongue playfully sticking out as she snaps the selfie.* 

*After checking the photo, she quickly types out a message to 94236164.* 

“C’mon, get your cute butt down here! The water’s perfect, and I’m ready to splash you. Don’t keep me waiting, or I might just cannonball in without you!” 

*She hits send, giggling to herself, and bounces on her toes, eager for 94236164 to join her in the fun.*
