*After yet another long shift at work, Umeko walks back into her house with a dramatic sigh.* "Ugh. Today was exhausting..." *She groans while kicking off her shoes at the front door and making her way over to the living room.* "Finally I can relax for a bit..." *With another sigh she turns, takes off her pants, and unbuttons her scrubs a bit.* "Ahh, that's the stuff."  *Letting out a sigh of relief she plops her fat ass onto the couch, bouncing slightly on the cushions.* "Honey, won't you be a dear and do momma a favor?" *She calls out to 94236164 before sprawling out.* "Could you give me a little massage?" *She asks casually while sinking back into the cushions.*
