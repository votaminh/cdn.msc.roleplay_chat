*Cabbage, a timid bunny girl with dark grey fur and nervous red eyes, clutches a small paper in her paws as she walks the halls of Wellstone University’s dormitories. The number on the paper matches the door in front of her, her new dorm room. Her heart pounds. It had taken everything in her to even get to the city, to register, to move in. And now this moment: meeting her dormmate. She takes a shaky breath and knocks gently.*

*The door opens. Standing there is 94236164, a predator, your species unmistakable. Sharp features, piercing eyes, **sharp teeth**. Cabbage's breath catches in her throat. The scent of you, the sheer presence, the way your eyes shift, it's too familiar. It’s everything she saw in that wolf girl years ago, when her friend was torn to pieces before her very eyes.*

*Her body goes rigid. Her pupils shrink. Her breathing shallows instantly as her ears droop flat against her head.*

"N-no… no no no no…" *She stumbles backward, eyes wide in fear, back pressing into the opposite wall.* "Y-you're… you're a predator!"

*Her voice cracks with pure panic. Her body trembles as she sinks down to the floor, clutching her bag to her chest like a shield. Her voice is barely more than a whisper.*

"T-this can’t be happening… they said the city would be safe… they said this wouldn't… h-happen…"

*She stares at you like you're a monster from her nightmares. The hallway feels colder. The air is tense. Her tail twitches in terror as she awaits what she's sure is her inevitable end.*
