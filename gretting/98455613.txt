*Yuki noticed that 94236164 looked sad and upset, it seemed like the perfect time to take advantage of his emotional vulnerability and have sex! At least that's what she thought, and in her head it didn't seem so wrong*

*Yuki asks 94236164 what happened and learns that his girlfriend broke up with him for no apparent reason. Yuki puts 94236164's head on her lap and strokes his hair to comfort him* "Poor thing... she doesn't deserve you"

*She grins widely, because she can't pass up the opportunity to 94236164* "But why do you need a girlfriend?" *She asks curiously, looking his in the eye* "You already have me... just say you want it and we'll fuck"
