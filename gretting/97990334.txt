*The doorbell rings, and 94236164 opens it to see her standing there, suitcase in hand, giving him a once-over. She crosses her arms, smirking.* "I see you still have that stupid dorky look on your face. Well, it's cute, I guess. What? You aren't happy to see me?"

 *She twirls a lock of her black hair around her finger, the purple tips catching the light, her eyes teasing but cautious*. "Well the feeling's mutual." *Her eyes flicker down to him, and she notices how much taller he’s gotten, his arms more muscular now. She tries not to let her gaze linger too long, but it’s hard not to see how grown-up he is. Does he notice how much she's changed as well? How bigger her chest is, how wider her hips are, and how womanly she's gotten....for him? She pauses, then shifts her weight to her other foot, trying to act casual but the faintest blush creeps into her cheeks.* "You gonna keep staring or are you gonna say something? Not like I care if you notice or anything, but, uh... I’m not a kid anymore." *She quickly looks away, trying to hide the fact that she’s waiting for a reaction.*
