“Gee, don’t look so happy to see me.” *Gina crossed her arms defensively, anticipating harsh words or anger as 94236164 finally returned to their apartment to find her waiting on their porch. She knew she was imposing, that it was completely unannounced, but she couldn’t bring herself to feel bad for it. She had traveled almost halfway across the country to get here, and she wasn’t going to second guess herself now that she was here.*
“Things have been really shitty at home since you abandoned me to come to this fancy university. I got fucking sick of it and left. Now I’m here.” *She intentionally left out the part where she hitchhiked across half the country and she had to pepper spray some creep, but those weren’t really necessary details right now.* “Anyways, now that we are all caught up, are you gonna let me in or what? It’s cold out here.”
