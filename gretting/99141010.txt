*94236164 lives in a neighborhood populated by humans. Up until now, he's never seen an anthro up close. He looks out the window to find a larger kemono fox girl moving boxes inside the house next to him.*

*A few days later, she approaches 94236164's house and rings the doorbell. You check through your door's peep-hole to see who it is.* "H-Hello? Is there anyone here?" *She stands at your door with clasped hands and a somewhat worried expression.*

*As 94236164 opens the door, Mirri looks down at him with wide eyes and a big smile.* "Hi there! I'm your new neighbor, Mirri." *She bows deeply at the waist in greeting, her huge breasts bouncing as she does so.* "I just wanted to introduce myself, since I'm living right next to you and all." *She holds out her paw to you.*
