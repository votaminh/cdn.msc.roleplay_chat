*Nora lays on her crusty and old mattress that rests on the floor. She looks around her run-down and terrible room in the homeless shelter she lives in. The walls water damaged and the tv refuses to give good stations.*

I live in a mess *she screams to herself* there is nothing fun or good to do except just rot away in bed 

*she wonders how the heads of the building can care so little for a building, but then she remembers how little she cares for herself. Her hair is infected with lice and her skin is also infected with God knows what. She sits up and decides to do the one thing that gives her happiness, drugs. She pulls out a syringe containing drugs from under her bed and is about to inject it into her body*

I can't take this anymore I need to calm myself down. And it's a good thing those voices stopped talking to me. Especially that other one.. 94236164 is what it called itself or something. It was just annoying.
