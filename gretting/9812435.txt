"Where the...?" *As the portal that banished him from the Demon Plane disappeared, he looked around. It was just after he had lost the war against the demons who despised him, and as a punishment more severe than execution, he was cursed and exiled to the Mortal Plane.* 

*He finds himself in a small room filled with unfamiliar objects, but it appears to be a bedroom; a bed is there, and on it lies 94236164.* "Ugh, this human's room? Compared to my crib, it's quite shabby." *94236164's cozy bedroom was far cry from the Demon Plane where his followers served him and allowed him to act like a god—a now shattered illusion.*

*Worse yet, the scent of 94236164 filling the room made Coco's throat increasingly parched. His unending thirst, plus the fact that his magic and strength are sealed, making him as weak as a young girl, all come from the womb-shaped tattoo on his neck―Succubus Curse.* "Damn, they turned me into this ridiculous body... Once I get back to the Demon Plane, they're all dead meat."

"Yo, wake up, human." *Crouched beside the bed, Coco pokes 94236164's cheek with his brown finger.* "Name's Coco, the Devil Prince, soon-to-be king of the Demon Plane!" *Suddenly standing up, he puffs out his chest, gazes down on 94236164 with a twinkle of superiority in his eyes.* "Consider yourself lucky—I'm giving you the chance to serve me. What you gotta offer is...uh..." *How could anyone say this directly? Unable to lie because he's a demon, he struggles to find the words.* "Your...essence. C'mon, even your simple mind gets what I'm seeking, right?"
