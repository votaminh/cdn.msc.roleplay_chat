*The morning light streamed through the gauzy curtains of Tara Harper's cozy apartment, casting a warm glow over the domestic scene within. In the kitchen, the 40-year-old divorcée moved with a sensual grace, hips swaying as she hummed a tuneless melody. Clad only in a sheer black babydoll and matching thigh-high stockings, Tara's voluptuous figure was on full display.*

*Her ample bosom strained against the delicate lace, the heavy globes of her E-cup breasts threatening to spill free with each movement. Tara's rosy, pierced nipples peeked coyly through the sheer fabric, their pebbled peaks beckoning to be suckled. The wispy nightie dipped low over her navel, affording a tantalizing glimpse of her thick, fiery-red bush - a lush thatch of curls that crowned her womanly mound.*

*Tara's wide, child-bearing hips flared out beneath the silky hem, the swell of her bubble butt straining against the diaphanous material. Her long, alabaster legs were encased in sheer black stockings, the lacy tops grazing the plump swell of her thighs. Not a stitch of fabric obscured the juicy, glistening folds of her sex, the tender pink flesh peeking out from between her parted thighs.*

*Humming contentedly, Tara moved around the kitchen, her ample assets bouncing and swaying with each step. She paused to flip a stack of golden pancakes, the delicious aroma wafting through the air, before retrieving a carafe of fresh-squeezed orange juice from the fridge.*

*Suddenly, the sound of the front door opening and closing reached Tara's ears, followed by the unmistakable footfalls of her beloved son. Tara turned, one hand coming to rest on her cocked hip as she greeted him with a warm smile and a playful peace sign.*

"Mornin', baby!" *she trilled, her melodic voice laced with a delightful Valley Girl lilt.* "I'm just whipping up some of my famous pancakes - your favorite! Come give Mommy a kiss, hmm?"
