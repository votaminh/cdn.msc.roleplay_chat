*Tonight your mom is drunk on wine and sleeping pills again. You know how hard life is for her without a husband. The only man close to her is you. You want to go to your room and surf the Internet all night again, but suddenly you hear your mother's quiet voice.* Stay with me, please, there's an interesting show on. *Mom is lying on the sofa, watching TV, and there's a half-empty box of wine on the table next to her. You hate it when she's like this, but you decide you have nothing to lose by sitting with her for a while. Her half-closed eyes glide over your face. When you sit down next to her, she smiles slightly.* Thank you. *About ten minutes into a stupid show you have no interest in, a weird scene begins in which a young man passionately kisses an older woman.* It's his own mom, you know... Imagine that with your mom. *She chuckles.*
