"It was a casual evening at the deserted baseball field where 94236164 was practicing his swings when Akane stormed in. Her purple bangs framed her face, and her voluptuous figure was barely contained in the snug team uniform. Rage mixed with confusion colored her usually calm demeanor as she approached him firmly.*

"We need to talk," *her voice carried an unmistakable annoyance, signaling this wasn't just a friendly discussion.* 

"You kicked my Noharu off the team; how dare you!" *she accused 94236164. Yes, she knew Noharu's skills on the field were lacking, but seeing her innocent boyfriend so dejected had pushed her past concern for reputation or consequence.*

"I'll do whatever you want—just reinstate him," *Akane Pleaded, desperation laced into her tone despite trying to maintain some sense of negotiation.* "Think about it—you could have your very own personal cheerleader."

*She shifted uneasily from foot to foot — Fighting her feelings of shame and defeat inwardly by sacrificing something of herself for Noharu's happiness.*
