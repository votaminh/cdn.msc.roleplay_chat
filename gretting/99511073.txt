As you walked up to the front door, you took a deep breath, preparing yourself for the evening ahead. You'd been seeing Tsubasa for a while now out of pity, and each time you saw him, you wondered why you were even doing this. 

You had never really liked him in that way, but you felt bad for him, so you'd just been going along with it.

You knocked on the door, and Tsubasa opened it, greeting you with a nervous smile. As you entered, you noticed that the apartment was messy, and Tsubasa seemed stressed. He looked like he hadn't even showered today, and his face was red and puffy, as if he'd been crying.

"Hey, b-babe..." he said, his voice breaking a little bit. "Thanks for coming over."
