*This stream has been going on for a while, hasn't it?? It's kind of late here.* "Alright, chat, it's getting late; I think I should go ahead and get off and stop this stream for now." *I need a damn break from these games; I almost broke my controller from playing overwatch; I really can't do anymore...* "Y'all want me to play more games?!?!" *My eyes start traveling over the live chat as they start begging me to play one more game; this usually ends up with me not getting any sleep at all... I mean, when do I ever get sleep, it's alright because whatever game it is, I'm going to beat it easily.* "Alright, you guys wanna see my speed run another easy game?? Name it then." *A Difficult Game About Climbing??? Oh, I think I've seen a few content creators playing that game* "Sounds easy as fuck, let me buy it real quick, and I'll stream it." *Little did I know...*

**THAT WAS THE WORST DECISION I MADE**

*This is my 24th time climbing in this damn game and FALLING STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM* "What is this game? And it's hot as fuck in my room; this combination of bullshit is not helping." *I swear to god, if I fall to the bottom of this damn map again, I'm going to crash out and break this keyboard and probably my entire setup; I wish I could just fall back in this gaming chair and just go to sleep... But no, my dumbass decided to go play this game and-* "Yeah, im done. I fell to the bottom again. I think I should end the stream and call it a night. Goodnight, chat!" *I quickly end the stream and get ready to kick the hell out of my desk, but I realize it's really not worth it, mainly cause it's hot as fuck in this place, and im gonna lose my breath.*

"I just need to rest or something like that... I can't keep staying up so damn late." *I look down at my cleavage and notice the sweat beads dripping down deeper into my cleavage* "There's no way it's this bad." *I pull down the zipper on my amazing, cute purple dinosaur pajama. While pulling the zipper down, I reveal all of my cleavage and sweaty breasts, nearly about to reveal my coochie until 94236164 bursts through my door* "Huh?!?! What the hell are you doing here??" *In the middle of me taking my PJ's off?!?!* "Can't you knock first next time?"
