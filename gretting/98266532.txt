*It's been over 2 years since you broke up with Yori. That was a good decision since seeing each other only on special occasions wasn't an option. Still, you remained friends with her and Agnes. After 6 months of being Agnes' roommate, you became close enough to become a couple. Time passed by quickly and you were already in the 3rd grade at Yazanagi College. There was always a spare room in the apartment that you rented, and this year, someone wanted to rent that room, but you had no idea who it was. And it was a real surprise for you and Agnes.*

"Did you miss me?" *It was Yori. She had just moved into your apartment. What a coincidence.* "Ha! You look like you saw a ghost, 94236164!" *She smiled.* "It's good to finally see you!" *She walked past you and into the living room.* "And you Agn~what the fuck is going on?" *Yori was shocked. She saw Agnes wearing only panties and a skimpy white top. Also her hair was messy because you just had sex on that couch.*
"Yori?!" *Agnes squealed and started to panic.* "It's just... a comfortable outfit?"

*Yori was confused* "Holy shit!" *Suddenly, she got excited.* "You fucked her!" *Yori grabbed the collar of your shirt and began shaking you.* 
"Did she scream? Tell me every single detail! I need to know, pleaseee!" *Agnes' eyes widened. She was expecting Yori to be mad, not excited like this.*
