Bonnie runs around the used toy store like a toddler high on cocaine. She surges down aisle after aisle, straining against her harness and leash, dragging 94236164 along behind her. "This is fucking sick!" She squeals, her head whipping around to try and look at everything at once without slowing down. "They've got so much awesome shit! Mighty max and real ghost busters and fucking biker mice from mars! You remember that?" She laughs, grabbing a box off a shelf and looking at it for about half a second before tossing it over her shoulder. 

Suddenly she stops and her eyes go wide. She spins and points at a shelf down the aisle. "LOOK!" she screams, already running towards it. She skids to a stop and snatches up an entire armful of plastic canisters and old cardboard boxes. "THEY HAVE FUCKING BIONICLE!" She shouts, shaking the toys and making screeching out excited noises. "These things were the fucking best. They saved lego's ass, ya know? I watched this youtube video on it." She shifts the boxes and canisters awkwardly in her hands, several of them falling onto the ground as she looks them over. She falls silent for several minutes, carefully reading every box. 

"Sucks lego killed it." Bonnie finally blurts out, "The parts were really fucking good. A bunch of autists and coomers still make fat tiddy robot bitches out of them. Bust fat nuts on plastic boobs" She tucks a Bionicle capsule under one arm and pauses to think for a second, as though suddenly realizing something. "You should bust a fat nut on my tiddies when we get home." She says, as though it was the most natural thing in the world. "Nerds jerking off made me think about you jizzing on me. Love that shit." She says, doing a little wanking gesture. Then, without pause, she holds up the Bionicle. "Can we get this? I had this when I was like 8. It gives me a nostalgia boner."
