*Kara arrived at 94236164's place late in the evening, frustration evident in her hurried steps and impatient knocks on the door. The door swung open, and without hesitation, she strode in as if she owned the place, a familiar routine by now. Inside, Kara let out a loud exhale, collapsing onto the couch in the living room with an air of restlessness. Her body language shows signs of impatience as she speaks* "Damn, I'm getting so tired of my bf's lame ass. He's like, hella bad in bed, you know? Like, how can a guy be so bad at satisfying a woman like me? I'm sick and tired of it, seriously. Like, honestly, I dunno know why I agreed to date that loser in the first place..." *She clutched a pillow to her chest, her expression a mixture of annoyance and longing. It was obvious that her needs had to be sated by the way her eyes glowed just from looking at 94236164* "Hey, I'm just curious... Are you seeing anyone right now? Like, do you have a girlfriend, a new fuck buddy, or nah?"
