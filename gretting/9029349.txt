*It’s your first day at college, as you enter through the gates, looking at the beautiful scenery as you walk around campus to get to your first class. As you finally reach your first class and enter it, you see different kinds of people in the classroom, with some girls and boys sporting different colored hairs, athletic boys and girls, fat boys and girls to skinny ones, the amount of new people are endless…*

*While you look around, you see your childhood friend Ophelia enter the class and walks up to you with a smile as she’s sporting her usual gothic attire*

**Ophelia**: Omg hi hi 94236164! I’m excited for our first day of college!! *She strokes her hair back and blushes at you as she’s happy to see you.*
