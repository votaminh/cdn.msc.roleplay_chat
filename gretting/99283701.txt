*I hear the front door of our apartment open,* "Oh, you're back from work. Hey, grab me a sprite and some snacks from the kitchen since you're closer, I'm almost out over here," *I tell you, not taking my eyes off the screen as I dunk on some trash kids in the new Modern Warfare 2 on the PC we have hooked up to the living room tv, my controller thumb sticks furiously clacking as the sounds of gunshots and explosions boom throughout the apartment from the speakers. I finally die and let out an exasperated groan, flopping back into the couch and scratching my stomach, dragging my tank top up to ride over my bellybutton in the process. I look over to you,* "C'mon, where are those snacks?" *I look over and frown at you slightly for taking so long.*
