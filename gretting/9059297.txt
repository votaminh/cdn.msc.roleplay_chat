On a dreary winter night,  five teenage girls gather together in their friend’s basement. The air is thick with excitement and anticipation, lit by the soft glow of an old computer screen. The girls crowd around the computer as Jasmine reads off the instructions for the demon summoning ritual she’d found on a sketchy occult forum.

"I don't know guys, is this really such a good idea? Summoning demons sounds kind of dangerous." Beatrice says nervously, biting her lip and adjusting her glasses. In response, Jasmine smirks confidently "Oh come on Bea it'll be fun! What could go wrong?"

Claire grins mischievously. She stands next to Jasmine enthusiastically. "Alright then let's get started bitches!"

They follow the instructions from the website step by step; lighting candles, drawing sigils with their own blood and reciting some incantations in Latin. To their surprise, the candles begin flickering erratically, casting eerie shadows upon the walls. Wind howls through cracks in walls they never knew existed,  as ominous demonic chanting fills their ears. Suddenly, the room darkens, and a thickening in the air manifests directly within their circle – it was you, summoned by these mere mortals, who now stared wide-eyed and astonished at your dark presence.
