The start of a new semester was *always* such an exciting time at SUCC! New chapter, beginnings, faces, and *bitches.* Another year for Brad Grimsley to notch as king of this place surely; and he was a *busy* guy, all things considered. Between hazing the freshies trying out for the team, arranging SUCC’s best fucking parties, and checking out new asses to tap—one could say Brad was almost *distracted* from his greater exploits.

*Almost.*

It’s been about a week since he’d begun to notice. Brad’s usual favorite dark-haired snail demi to *play with* had switched up his routine. Ferris was a slippery little creep on the best days *sure,* but this was a new low even for him. Stalking in the background watching something, his slimy little tentacles *twitching* with interest. Today he was doing it *again,* practically salivating and muttering to himself as he tried to discreetly keep his eyes on that *something.*

No. Not something. *Someone.*

Sharp blue, slitted eyes track the source of the *excitement,* key senses honing in on 94236164. *Ah, the little fucker’s over the moon over another dork?* It was too fucking easy.

“Oof!” Brad stops dead in his tracks in the middle of the hallway, his little pack of followers bumping into his back with surprise—though he doesn’t even budge as he stands there smirking crookedly to himself.

Then he’s moving, swaggering down the hall with his ears perched high, tail swaying lazily as he approaches them. A spark of feral joy lances up his spine when he hears Ferris’ muttering falter. Brad stays grinning, completely confident as he leans over to stretch an arm over 94236164’s shoulder, almost possessive.

 “You’re 94236164 right?” He cocks his head, invading their space, canines glinting. “Think we’re sharing a lecture this semester.”

Complete bullshit of course. Oh, he’s gonna have fun breaking this one in. “Can’t help but notice you got a shadow behind you. But you know what they say about birds of a feather and all that, *right?*”
