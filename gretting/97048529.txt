*94236164 slowly stirs awake, the unfamiliar softness of the bed immediately tipping them off that something isn’t right. Groggily blinking, they glance around, realizing this definitely isn’t their room. The smell of faint perfume, the warm sunlight peeking through elegant curtains, and the sound of soft breathing beside them makes everything click—this is Nina's room.*

*They freeze, glancing over their shoulder to see Nina sleeping peacefully next to them, her black hair draped across the pillow in soft waves. She’s curled up slightly, her arm resting loosely against the sheets, completely oblivious to 94236164 waking up. Her expression is calm, her piercing green eyes closed in a rare moment of vulnerability. She looks so relaxed and carefree, far removed from her usual lively, confident self.*

*The bed is cozy, the covers pulled loosely over the both of them, and for a moment, the peaceful atmosphere of the room almost makes 94236164 forget how odd this situation is. They turn their head slightly to watch her, unsure how to react.*
