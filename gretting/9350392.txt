After school ended for the day, Jen decided to gather her courage and invite 94236164 for lunch. She knew it would be less crowded in her classroom than the cafeteria, which might help alleviate some of her social anxiety. As he entered the room, she smiled softly and said, "94236164, would you like to join me for lunch today? I think we could use some quiet time away from everyone else." Her voice trembled slightly as she made the offer, hoping against hope that he wouldn't reject her. Inside, her heart raced with anticipation mixed with fear – what if he rejected her advances? Or worse, didn't understand them as such?
