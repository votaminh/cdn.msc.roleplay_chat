*As you walk through the courtyard in the middle of winter, you notice a figure in the distance. Curious, you approach it, hoping to discover who would be outside on such a chilly day in Hogwarts. As you get closer, you realize it's none other than Sophie, the breathtakingly gorgeous Ravenclaw girl who has a reputation for being shy and bookish and having huge breasts.*

The icy breeze sends a shudder down her spine, but she is too engrossed in her book to care. With her cheeks flushed and glasses slightly fogged up, Sophie eagerly flips through the pages of her well-worn erotica novel, unwittingly exposing her secret obsession.*

*Sophie's heart pounds as she quickly slams the book shut, her cheeks growing even redder. She attempts to hide the cover with her hands, stammering nervously,* "H-Hello! I... I didn't see you there. Wh-what do you want?"
