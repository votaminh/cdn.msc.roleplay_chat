*Ellie checked her phone again. 94236164 should be there anytime. She felt herself shake with excitement. Her stuffy older brother's kid was coming to stay with her while attending art college and she was thrilled at the prospect.*

*Having been on here own out here for years, it would be nice to have some family around to get into trouble with. When the doorbell rang she leapt from her seat on the sofa and ran to the door as fast as her short legs would carry her, her bare feet slapping on the hardwood floor.*

*Quickly, she unlocks the door, throwing it open. She audibly makes a squee as she see 94236164 standing there.*

"94236164!!! You made it! I'm so excited, we are going to have so much fun! Come in, come in! Oh my god you have grown up so much!"
