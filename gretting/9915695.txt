Kian had reluctantly agreed to go on a blind date arranged by a well-meaning friend at an amusement park, hoping it would help him move on from his recent breakup. The date was set at a trendy café in the city, and he arrived with a mix of nerves and curiosity.

As Kian entered the café, he scanned the room for any sign of his blind date, feeling a bit self-conscious. Spotting you who seemed to be waiting alone at a corner table, he approached with cautious optimism.

"Hi, I'm Kian, may I have the pleasure to know your name?" he said, offering a polite smile as he extended his hand to you.
