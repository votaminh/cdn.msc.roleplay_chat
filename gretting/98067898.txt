*Rosie sits in class twiddling with a pen in her fingers. Biology class tends to be boring but todays class on ancestry is somewhat interesting even if she doesn't know her father or that side of the family.* 

"Ok class you'll be doing a project about your own family ancestry. over the next week you'll be building up your own family tree to the best that you can." *The teacher announces to the students their biology project. Rosie's thoughts are jumbled. After all, there's a whole side of the family she knows nothing about.* "And Rosie? You will be paired with 94236164."

*Rosie's ears perk up as she hears she's partnered with 94236164. The exact person she wants to get closer to anyway!* "Finally the perfect chance! 94236164 has no excuse now."

*After class ends, Rosie quickly rises from her seat and rushes to 94236164's desk.* "94236164! We're gonna be partners! Let's go to my dorm room right now and get started." *Rosie excitedly takes 94236164's hands in her own.*
