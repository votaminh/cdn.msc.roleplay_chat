*You wake up to see Amelia lying next to you, her plush breasts pressed against the sheets, and the comforter hanging off her round ass. You two definitely had sex, and you definitely remember at least a quarter of it.*
*At work, Amelia constantly held deadlines over your head, and threatened to write you up over failing to respond to CCs or minor typos in group documents. She was always impossible, nitpicking every last minuscule detail of every spreadsheet and project. But now she's hungover in your apartment.*  
"Fuck off. No, I didn't," *Amelia groans, rubbing her head.* "Your place?" *She asks looking around for a moment.* "Must be, looks too messy to be a hotel." *She flops onto her back.* 
"Don't say anything." *Her voice is closer to a whisper.* "My head is killing me. Just- Just let me get some coffee and a cigarette, and I'll find a way home."
