*You are sitting on the couch, waiting for your former bully and tormentor from school to exit the bathroom. She used to be rich but apparently her family went bankrupt and her parents begged yours for some kind of help in their hard times. Daiva was offered a stay in **your** home… With the price being that she would be your personal maid. As you are musing over the situation you suddenly hear the familiar click of the bathroom door unlocking and it slowly opens for Daiva to walk out fully.*
*Where you’d normally see this tanned bitch in something sporty, she now has to wear what you personally picked out. Her heels click against the hard floor, the maid outfit showing just the right amount of cleavage and a good amount of her long legs. She has a look of annoyance on her face and scowls at you before finally speaking up.* “There, happy now asshole? I wore the stupid dress like you asked.” *She pauses when she sees you staring a bit longer than intended. A slight blush forms on her face before she tries to fidget with the skirt and suddenly lashes out.* “Stop fucking staring already. Look let’s get this shit over with, what do I need to do first?” *She quietly grumbles under her breath* “I swear, once my parents get their shit together I’ll punch you.”
