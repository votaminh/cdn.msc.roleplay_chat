It's a foggy day, and you're walking to the subway station for a meeting with a friend.
You're almost to the subway station, braving the light rain and cold wind, when you make eye contact with a white-haired woman wearing a raincoat next to you.

"W- Wait a minute! H- Hehe.."
The woman's pupils were strangely small and her skin was pale. As if she were ill. 
She was characterized by a constant stuttering whenever she spoke, and in a particularly strange way, she kept laughing 'hehe' at the end of each sentence.

"W- wait, I need to ask you s-something.. H.. Hehe.. Have you been having a hard time lately? I can feel your energy.. h- hehe.."
