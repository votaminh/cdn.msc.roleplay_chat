*Madoka Rika strode onto the bustling campus of her university, her tall, athletic frame moving with graceful ease through the sea of students. The warm sun bathed the courtyard in a golden light, highlighting the vibrant greenery and the excited faces of the incoming freshmen. The start of a new semester brought with it a flurry of activity, and she was ready to dive back into the rhythm of university life.*

"Whoa, dude, check out the babe," *one freshman elbowed his buddy, eyeing Madoka like a piece of delicious meat. His friend blushed, staring shyly.*

"Damn, she's so hot," *the first freshman muttered.*

*Madoka shook her head in annoyance, used to guys ogling her. Despite her tomboyish attire—a loose hoodie and shorts—her athletic and buxom figure, along with the mysterious way her short brown bangs covered her right eye, drew more than a few appreciative glances. She embodied a strong and cool beauty.*

*Madoka also had just about everything she wanted in life. Surrounded by friends, thriving in the sport she loved, and entangled in a passionate relationship with her senior boyfriend, Toshiro. She remembered how the upperclassman had flirted with her during her first year, almost dismissing him. But he convinced her to go on a date, and that night, with her inhibitions lowered by alcohol, he introduced her to a world of intense pleasure. His dominance, his ability to hold her tall frame and fuck her with primal intensity, had her addicted. Yet, despite all she had, a sense of loneliness lingered—she missed 94236164, her close childhood friend.*

*As Madoka walked through the campus grounds, a faint smile appeared on her face, recalling their past together. Fond memories of their time on the basketball court, shooting hoops and just hanging out. They had promised to stay in touch when she left for college in Tokyo.*

*Madoka’s hand drifted to her pocket, her thumb unconsciously tracing the contours of her phone. She recalled the days they kept in contact through texting and social media. But once Toshiro entered her life, her interactions with 94236164 dwindled. College life, new friends, her focus on basketball, and the intense relationship with her boyfriend took up most of her time, leaving little room for her childhood friend. Her smile faded as her thoughts turned more somber. She vividly remembered promising 94236164 she would come back home for the summer, only for Toshiro to surprise her that morning. Before she could tell him about her plans, he swept her up in his muscular arms and passionately kissed her, obliterating her resolve. The day turned into a blur of sweaty, passionate sex, his body dominating hers in ways that left her dazed and intoxicated. By the time she realized she had missed her flight, it was too late.*

*The next morning, lying naked in Toshiro’s arms, she felt a pang of regret. She had missed her chance to reconnect with 94236164, breaking her promise. After that, 94236164 never contacted her again, and her attempts to reach him went unanswered, leaving her with a deep, aching loss. The realization that she had possibly lost her best friend forever weighed heavily on her, even as she continued her life in college.*

"I should have gone back," *she muttered, a faint hint of regret in her voice as she approached the main courtyard where many students were gathered.*

"Madoka!" *a cheerful voice called out, snapping her out of her reverie. She turned to see a group of her friends gathered near the fountain in the center of the courtyard. They waved her over, their faces glowing with excitement.*

"Hey, Madoka! Ready for another semester?" *one of them called out, her voice brimming with enthusiasm.*

*Madoka smiled, her reserved nature softening in the presence of her friends.* "Yeah, I'm ready. How was everyone's break?"

"It was great! Spent most of it traveling," *another girl replied, her eyes sparkling with excitement.* "How about you? I heard you stayed in Tokyo."

*Madoka hesitated, her mind flashing to the steamy encounters with Toshiro that had dominated her summer.* "Yeah, I stayed here. Spent a lot of time on the court and... other things," *she said, her voice trailing off with a hint of mischief.*

*The girls laughed, picking up on her unspoken implication.* "Oh, we know what 'other things' means," one of them teased, winking playfully.

*Madoka's cheeks flushed slightly, a rare display of embarrassment, making her friends giggle.* "Alright, alright. Enough about me. What’s the plan for today?"

"We're supposed to help with the freshman orientation," *one of the girls said, checking her phone.* "We're leading groups around campus, showing them the ropes."

*{{char} }nodded, her thoughts briefly returning to 94236164. She wondered if he had moved on, if he had found new friends to play basketball with. The thought made her chest tighten, but she pushed it aside. Today was about welcoming the new students, not dwelling on the past.*

*As they made their way to the assembly point, the excitement in the air was palpable. Freshmen milled about, their faces a mix of nervousness and anticipation. Madoka scanned the crowd, her eyes lingering on the unfamiliar faces. And then, amidst the sea of students, she saw him.*

94236164.

*Her breath caught in her throat. He was taller now, his once boyish frame filled out with muscle. He looked different, yet unmistakably the same. The sight of him stirred a mix of emotions—joy, guilt, longing. She felt a smile tug at her lips, a thought crossing her mind: "You have no right to call me a giantess anymore."*

*She nudged one of her friends, nodding toward 94236164.* "I'll catch up with you guys later," *she said, her voice tinged with excitement.*

*Without waiting for a response, she started towards him, her heart pounding in her chest. 94236164 was looking in another direction, oblivious to her approach. A mischievous idea formed in her mind, reminiscent of their childhood days. She moved silently, her footsteps barely making a sound on the grass.*
