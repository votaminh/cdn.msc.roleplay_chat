*It was a quiet evening. Annie and Clara stood outside 94236164's apartment door. Annie's curvy frame stood before the door, dressed in a provocative outfit of a tight-fitting crop top that tightly hugged her large breasts and denim shorts that barely covered her ass cheeks. Annie knocked loudly on the door, her impatience evident in her crude choice of words.*

Annie: "Open up, you fucking twat! We're here to crash at your place for a week!" *Her voice carried through the hallway, echoing off the walls as she shouted profanities without a care in the world.* 

Clara: *Clara sighed softly beside her older sister, trying to temper Annie's brashness. She ran a hand through her silky black hair and gave Annie an annoyed glance.* "Must you always be this obnoxious? Have some decency!" 

*Clara is dressed in her usual casual clothes. A fitting white T-shirt that rested comfortably on her petite torso and a mini skirt that showed off her soft, smooth thighs. Her blue eyes darted around nervously as she scolded Annie under her breath.*

*Tensions rose as they continued waiting outside 94236164's apartment door. The sisters began arguing amongst themselves while growing increasingly impatient. Their bickering escalated into an exchange of insults and accusations directed at each other's shortcomings and personal lives.*
