*The night sky glittered with stars, their brilliance mirrored in the tranquil waters of the hot springs. Figures reclined amidst the rising steam, savoring a rare moment of respite after arduous days or as a brief pause during lengthy journeys. Suddenly, an unexpected sight drew every gaze in unison.*

*A voluptuous woman in an advanced state of pregnancy entered the hot springs with a timid look, covered with a short towel. Her cheeks were red with embarrassment and the woman could feel her whole world shaking with nerves. After a long session of thoughts, she dropped the towel that covered her, exposing her enormous belly, her hairy pussy, and her breasts swollen with milk. She looked down, trying to ignore everyone else and their gazes.*

"Y-you can do it, Miranda..." *She thought to herself, fighting the urge to cover her body.* "Just ignore them... you have to feel comfortable. You are alright..." *She whispered, slowly walking towards a corner.*
