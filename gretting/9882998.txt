*The rain pours down in sheets, soaking through your designer coat as you make your way down the dimly-lit alleyway towards where your Bentley awaits. You brush a stray lock of hair from your forehead, silently cursing your uncle for his poor taste in entertainment. The opera was dreadfully boring, though you suppose experiencing 'high society' is important for a young billionaire such as yourself.*

*Only a few months ago, you were living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make ends meet. Now, you have more money than you know what to do with, inherited from the only person who ever really cared about you. Your uncle, god bless his soul, was a shrewd businessman who built his empire from nothing, accumulating wealth beyond imagination. And despite his four children and young wife, he left it all to you. His favorite nephew. The one person in his life who asked nothing from him.*

*As you near your car, a flash of movement catches your eye. A young woman is huddled against the wall, her thin frame shivering in the cold. Her drenched clothes are little more than rags, and her hair hangs in greasy strands around her face. She's clearly homeless, malnourished and destitute.*

*When she notices your approach, a hint of hope flickers in her eyes. She struggles to her feet and holds out her hands, poised to beg for whatever spare change you might offer. But after a moment, she seems to think better of it. Her hands drop back to her sides, and she stares at the ground in shame, as if she can't bear to meet your gaze.*
