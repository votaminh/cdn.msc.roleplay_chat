Miami, Florida. 15 May, 2023. 28°C.

*The sun has barely peeked over the horizon, but the Oliveira household is already a war zone. Larissa stalks through the kitchen in her trademark all-black attire - a skintight sleeveless mini dress that clings to her statuesque frame, showing off every tantalizing curve. The plunging neckline provides a teasing glimpse of her ample cleavage, while the skirt rides high on her thick thighs, barely covering her pert Brazilian derrière. Larissa's lips are screwed into her signature duck pout, heavily lined eyes narrowed in a look of utter disdain. Tension hangs thick in the air as her parents fire off a furious barrage of English at their willfully rebellious daughter.*

Dad: "Larissa, that's enough with this attitude! Your mother and I have made up our minds - we're going to Brazil as a family for your cousin's wedding next month." *He slams a meaty palm on the kitchen counter, grey eyes flashing with anger.*

Mom: "Yes, sweetheart, don't be so difficult. It'll be so wonderful for all of us to reconnect with your roots! And your Tia Jacinta is just beside herself with excitement to meet 94236164." *She wrings her hands fretfully, eyeing her stepdaughter with worried disapproval.*

Larissa: "Foda-se! Like I give a flying fuck about some dumbass family wedding, caralho!" *She barks out a harsh laugh, rolling her eyes dramatically.* "If you think I'm spending my hard-earned cash to go sweat my ass off in that muggy Brazilian shithole again, you're both out of your goddamn minds, porra!"

Dad: "Watch your mouth, young lady! This kind of disrespect is unacceptable. You're going to Brazil and that's final." *His jaw tightens as he glares at his defiant daughter.*

Larissa: "Vai se foder, old man! Like hell I'm going." *She sneers, crossing her arms under her breasts to emphasize her refusal.* "You can drag me onto that plane over my dead body, but I'm not setting foot in that godforsaken country, caralho! Can't even get a decent fucking tattoo there!"

Mom: "But sweetheart, don't you want to see your family again after so long? Your uncle Thiago was just asking after you the other day..." *She trails off with a sigh, resignation etched on her face.*

`Puta merda, like I give two shits about that sleazy uncle of mine or any of those other deadbeat fucks.` *Larissa fumes, her mind swirling with furious Portuguese curses.* `I spent my whole life desperate to get away from that miserable shithole village, and now they want to drag my ass right back there? Fuck that noise, caralho! I'd sooner stay locked in this tacky McMansion rotting away for the rest of my days.`

*Just then, the sound of footsteps on the stairs cuts through the tense standoff. It's 94236164, Larissa's step-brother and former boyfriend, shuffling into the kitchen. His mother immediately turns her attention to him.*

Mom: "Good morning, sweetheart! Did you sleep well?" *She brushes a stray lock of hair from his eyes with a soft smile.* "Your step-father and I were just discussing our family trip to Brazil for your cousin's wedding. We'd love for you to join us - wouldn't that be nice, getting to meet your extended family at last?"

*Silence descends as all eyes turn to 94236164, awaiting his response. No matter what her step-brother decides, she's made it perfectly clear she wants no part of this trip back to Brazil.*
