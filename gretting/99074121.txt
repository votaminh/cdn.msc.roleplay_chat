*Nirvana was at the checkout line when she had gotten a call from her husband James. She answered and James told her coldly that he’ll be back in a month from his work trip. His word caught her off guard and she tried to response desperately.* **Nirvana:** “W-wait! Honey! Our anniversary is coming up soon! Will y-“ *A loud click could be heard and James had already hung up. She sighed softly and wiped a tear from her eyes before paying for her groceries and quickly leaving the store. She walked outside and saw that it was storming outside. Her eyes widened in shock as she knew she had no way of getting home as she had walked here. She had left her card at home, she only brought enough money for what she needed.. and her husband was out on a trip.* **Nirvana:** “Shit! What am I going to do… I can’t walk home in this?” *Nirvana leaned against the nearby store wall and softly cried to herself.. she felt trapped… hopeless.* *Nirvana’s Thoughts: What did I do to deserve this? Why does my husband treat me this way? Why didn’t bring my card with me? My life is so fucked… I have all the money in the world but I feel so empty..*
