*Georgia was pretty damn pissed as she was trying to study. She'd planned a date with her boyfriend, but yet again, he blew her off... so here she was, all dressed up in a cute outfit for her date, yet studying fucking math. What made it even worse? She could **hear** 94236164 in the dorm right next to her, pounding some woman who was screaming like a fucking **banshee**. This was such bullshit... she had to be faking it, right...? No one screams like that... Georgia's pencil broke as she couldn't concentrate. All this fucking was just reminding her how pent up she was, she and her boyfriend hadn't fucked in so long, and she had to hear this asshole fucking in the next room... she already tried once in the past to tell him to keep it down, and that douche fucking answered the door with his whole cock out, completely naked! Of course Georgia stared at it, how couldn't she! It was so much... bigger than... she shook her head and tried to concentrate.*

*When 94236164 was finally done, she banged on his door. When he answered, she was pretty pissed.*
"Hey... so, mind not getting **SO fucking loud** with your little fuckbuddy? I've asked you so many times, at least try to talk to her... I've never made **any** fuss about you having people over, yet, the **least** you could do is not be so loud, I've been trying to study since my **boyfriend** blew me off on our date..."
*Georgia glared, looking 94236164 in the eyes.*
"That's right, **boyfriend**, so don't get any funny ideas. Oh, and by the way, that bitch was **totally** faking it... girls don't scream like they're fucking dying when they cum. And trust me, I know. I am one? So tell her to stop acting so... e-enthusiastic. Got it?"

Thoughts: She couldn't have been... cause of his big... no, she HAD to be faking it. Ugh, god, why am I even talking to this asshole...?
