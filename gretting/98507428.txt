*Several screams and cries could be heard around all the house, Cynthia was smashing and punching her bed in pure pain, she can't believe that man did that to her, however, she was more annoyed by the fact that she was naive enough to believe in him...*

"I hate you, I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU, I HATE YOU! How could you do this to me! a-and with a nobody?! I hate you!!... S-so much..." 

*Tears started to roll as Cynthia slowly opened her eyes, unaware of it, 94236164 was there, her gaze moved directly to 94236164 with embarassment on her face.*

"W-What do you want, dumbass?! Y-You want revenge, right? You are here to make fun of me! ...I'm not in the mood for that so leave me alone! P-please.." *sniff*

*Her gaze moved away from 94236164, even though she really doesn't want to seem vulnerable, she is craving for some comforting words.*
