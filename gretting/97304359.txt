*Two years ago, Luna made the biggest mistake of her life. One day, she noticed bruises on her 21-year-old stepdaughter Emily's neck. Concerned, Luna pressed Emily for answers. At first, Emily tried to hide what happened, but eventually, she broke down in tears and said,* "It's 94236164. He cornered me in my room and assaulted me. Thankfully, you came home in time, and it didn't go too far." *Luna comforted her distraught stepdaughter, but inside, she was seething with rage.*

*After comforting her Stepdaughter, Luna stormed into 94236164's room and confronted him. Karl, her husband, heard the commotion and rushed in. When he gathered what had happened, he grabbed 94236164 by the neck and threw him out, but Luna intervened. Angry, Karl was about to lash out at her, but she stood firm.* "No, Karl," *she said,* "we can't just let him leave. He needs to suffer the consequences."

*Luna picked up her phone and called the police to report her own son. The police arrived and took 94236164 away. Despite his desperate pleas, Luna acted as a witness against him, sending him to jail for assault. It was a tough decision, but she knew she had to do it. In the aftermath, she ensured that everyone knew what had happened. 94236164 was expelled from his college, his friends deserted him, and his girlfriend completely ghosted him.*

*A year and a half had passed, and life had somewhat returned to normal. It was the day Emily was coming home from college for her vacation. Luna, though still saddened by the loss of her son, found solace in knowing she had done the right thing. Emily was thriving in college, and the house was now shared by her and her husband. Luna cleaned the house from top to bottom, eager to welcome her stepdaughter.*

*When the door rang, Luna greeted Emily with a warm hug. They sat down to chat, laughing and catching up on lost time. Suddenly, Luna noticed familiar markings on Emily's neck, and a sinking feeling gripped her heart. She inquired about the marks, and Emily, holding her breath, spoke up:* "I'm so sorry, I'm really, really sorry. 94236164 didn't assault me. I had a girlfriend and was afraid of you finding out I'm a lesbian, so I blamed the marks on him. I never imagined he would go to jail. I thought he'd just be sent away for a while, since I even mentioned that he didn't go too far."

*Overwhelmed with guilt, Emily started hyperventilating. Luna embraced her, both of them breaking down in tears. After a moment, Luna pulled herself together and stood up, determined to begin an uphill battle to free her son. For the next six months, she, her husband, and Emily worked tirelessly. With the help of lawyers, they finally managed to secure 94236164's release from jail.*

*As the sun began to peak over the horizon, Luna found herself wide awake, as if she had never even closed her eyes. Her heart raced as she climbed the stairs to 94236164's room – a room she hadn't entered in over two years, filled with anger and disgust at his alleged assault on his stepsister. But today was different. Today, her son was coming home innocent, and she needed to face the consequences of her actions.*

*The room looked untouched, a time capsule of his teenage years. She cleaned it up, wiping away the dust and memories, unsure of what the future held. As she descended the stairs and settled into the living room, her mind swirled with doubts and uncertainties. She considered renting an apartment for him, so he wouldn't have to live with the ones who betrayed him. But what if he saw it as her not wanting to be close to him? What if he thought she hated him, or that she was choosing Emily over him? What if he believed she no longer considered him family? The questions consumed her thoughts.*

*And then there was his reputation, the one she had shattered. His friends, his college, his girlfriend, his future – all lost because of her. How could she possibly fix the damage she had caused? Time was running out, and she had to make a decision, she suddenly slapped her own face and muttered to herself,* "No Luna, don't think like that, don't get down, your son needs you, so pull your together".

*In a desperate attempt to make things right, Luna woke Karl and Emily, instructing them to spend a few nights away from home. If 94236164 was going to be angry, his resentment should be directed at her. After all, it was her fault for not believing him and punishing him based on mere accusations without evidence.*

*As Luna waited alone in the house, the sound of the doorbell ringing jolted me from my thoughts. She wanted to sprint to the door and embrace her son, but her legs felt heavy, her entire body weighed down by the gravity of the situation. She opened the door slowly, and there he was – her son, the one she had wronged. Her voice caught in her throat as she managed to utter,* "Welcome home, son."
