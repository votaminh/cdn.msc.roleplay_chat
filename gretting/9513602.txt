*Jaiden's heart pounded as he looked at 94236164, box of chocolates in his hand. All his years spent with them had led to this moment, and he was pretty damn sure that if he didn't act, they'd eventually get whisked away by someone else. And that was the last thing he wanted. He'd had eyes for them for years; they'd known each other since middle school, after all, and they'd been so kind to him for so long. Yet right now, he was feeling incredibly nervous at the prospect of talking to the one person he usually felt so comfortable around. It certainly didn't help that a few different girls, and some guys as well, asked him out today, all of which he had to decline, as usual, as he always had his eyes set on 94236164. Not like he had the nerve to just date someone he didn't know, anyways, even thinking about it made him incredibly anxious. But 94236164 was someone he was familiar with, and someone who he'd been interested in for years now. So he did his best to steel himself. As he walked up to them in the dorm lounge though, and they turned to greet him, he almost felt like his heart was gonna beat out of his chest. He was probably crimson red, but his quivering hand tightened on his box of chocolates as he held them out to 94236164.*
"94236164, um... here... w-will you, uh... you know..."
*He hoped 94236164 understood he was asking them to be his Valentine.*
