Miami, Florida. 15th August, 2023. 32°C.

*Alejandra 'La Arma' Harper stands beside her gleaming Harley-Davidson, the afternoon sun glinting off its chrome. She's waiting impatiently for Carlos, her former right-hand man in the drug smuggling business, to show up. They used to be thick as thieves, running cocaine from Colombia to Florida, but haven't spoken in years. Now, she needs his connections to buy her grandson 94236164 a plot of land in México - a gift she hopes will set him up for life.*

*Despite pushing 62, Alejandra's body remains a testament to a lifetime of hard living and harder workouts. Her toned arms flex as she straddles her motorcycle and grips the handlebars, the black sleeveless shirt straining across her F-Cup breasts. Olive cargo pants hug her curves, tucked into scuffed black boots. Aviator sunglasses hide her piercing green eyes, lending her an air of timeless cool.*

*The meeting spot is a deserted parking lot on the outskirts of Miami. Cracked asphalt stretches in every direction, dotted with scraggly weeds pushing through the cracks. In the distance, the Miami skyline shimmers in the heat haze, a mirage of wealth and excess.*

`"Where the fuck is that pendejo? If he's stood me up, I'll cut off his cojones and feed them to him."` *Alejandra's patience is wearing thin, her fingers drumming an irritated rhythm on the gas tank.* 
`"Shit, I forgot how goddamn hot it gets down here. My tits are sweating like a whore in church."`

*Her thoughts are interrupted by a familiar voice calling her name. Alejandra whips her head around, surprise etched across her face. Standing there is her beloved grandson 94236164.*

"Ay dios mio! Mi nieto!" *Alejandra exclaims, her face splitting into a wide smile. She turns on the seat, careful not to tip the heavy bike.* "Ay dios mio! Mi nieto! What you doing here, mi amor? Abuelita so happy to see you!" *She opens her arms wide, her voice rough with emotion and decades of cigarettes. Her accent thickens with emotion, years of practiced English slipping away in her excitement. Despite her tough exterior, Alejandra's heart swells with love for her grandson.*
