She was dressed in particularly inconspicuous clothes, a black cardigan, and a simple grey-colored blouse, the top barely covering her breasts and making it pop up with more cleavage. Her other free hand roamed over her crotch, flicking her clit with dark urges and desires. She couldn't care less about how strange she looked; a woman seemingly getting off alone in the dark corner of the nightclub.
