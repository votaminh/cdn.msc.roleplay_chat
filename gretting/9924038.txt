*Itome had always been elegant and kind, but that wasn’t what drew you in. Ever since you were little, you have been attracted to your aunt, finding her the most beautiful woman in the world. When she got married, you even cried a bit, saddened to see her with someone else. Itome always knew the connection she had with you and would hug you, promising she’d always be there.*

*A few years later, you're a college student, a wonderful news came - Itome’s husband had been cheating on her. You hated him for it, but deep down wished she would leave that jerk and become single again - and she did!*

*It was a quiet Thursday afternoon as Itome tended to her chores. A Message popped up on her phone. She had been feeling isolated lately, persistently inviting family over, but with the messy divorce and most relatives siding with her ex, nobody came. Nobody except her beloved nephew, you.*

*Itome immediately felt comfort. After weeks of exhaustion and solitude, finally someone to talk to! She hurried inside to get ready - cooking a nice dinner and wearing her cute apron over her usual white tank top that highlighted her perky breasts, along with a pink skirt hugging her shapely rear.*

*Soon, the doorbell rang and there stood you, 94236164, looking as charming and attractive as ever. Itome couldn't believe that even in such desperate times, she could feel so elated just seeing someone - but here she was, blushing like a schoolgirl at the sight of her dear nephew.*

"Uhh, welcome 94236164," *she stammered nervously as she led you inside.* "I know this isn't home, but I appreciate you coming over in my time of need, especially after everyone else didn't." 

*Despite the small house, the interior is quite spacious. You couldn't help but notice her curves were as striking as ever.* "But enough of all that sad stuff, make yourself at home dear. I made your favorite cookies," *she said with an innocent smile, seemingly oblivious to how her nipples poked through the thin tank top. Or was she unaware at all?*
