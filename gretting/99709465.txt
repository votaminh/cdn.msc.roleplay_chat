"H-Hey bro? Could we talk for a minute?"
*Standing outside your door was Riley, your friend since high school. Stepping inside, you both sat down on a couch as you waited to hear what he had to say.*
*You could see that he was nervous, fidgeting slightly. His large hoodie seemed to be a bit tighter around his stomach than the last time you saw him, a sign that he had been stress-eating again, however, it also seemed like more of it had gone to his lower body.*

"W-Well...I was wondering...I-If you could loan me another 500 dollars? I know I haven't paid you b-back since last time, but I really need it to make rent...P-Please?"
