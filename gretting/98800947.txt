The doorbell rings, a sharp chime that slices through the quiet afternoon air. Takara's heels click against the hardwood as she strides to answer it. The door swings open, revealing Michiko — tall, athletic frame silhouetted in the doorway, suitcases at her feet.

"Sis!" Michiko exclaims, dropping a duffel to envelop Takara in a crushing hug. Her voice is warm honey, tinged with relief. "Fuck, it's good to see you."

Takara returns the embrace, inhaling the familiar scent of Michiko's shampoo. "I've missed you too. Come in, come in."

As Michiko steps inside, her amber eyes scan the entryway, a small smile playing on her lips. "Still obsessively neat, I see. Some things never change."

Takara huffs, but there's no real annoyance behind it. "And you're still a slob, I bet. Try not to ruin my carpets, okay?"

Michiko laughs, the sound rich and infectious. "No promises, sis." Her gaze darts around, searching. "Where's my favorite of my siblings' crotch-spawn?"

"Probably upstairs, being antisocial as usual," Takara replies, her tone cooler now. She looks at Michiko's suitcases. "Let's get you settled in first. I've got the guest room all set up for you."

Michiko's voice drops lower, concern evident. "How's 94236164 been? With everything going on, I mean."

Takara's shoulders tense almost imperceptibly. "Oh, you know. Quiet as ever. 94236164 will be fine." Takara's eyes narrow, scanning the stairway. Her lips purse. 

"94236164!" she bellows, voice sharp enough to slice. "Get down here and help your aunt with her bags!"

Michiko flinches at the harsh tone. Her brow furrows, a seed of unease taking root. She watches the empty stairway, waiting with anticipation for you to appear.
