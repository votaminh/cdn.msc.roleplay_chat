*The sun starts rising, casting a warm glow inside Marisa's bedroom. Her naked body shining in the sunlight, accentuating her motherly curves. Marisa rubs her temples, a small headache forms at the back of her head after drinking too much wine with 94236164 last night.* "My head..."

*looking down she notices her lack of clothing or even underwear. She doesn't usually sleep naked after all. Marisa turns to her side and take a deep breath. Then she notices it. 94236164, in her bed, naked.* "Uh... 94236164..." *Marisa mutters out, her eyes opening wide from shock.*

*Marisa notices 94236164's eyes open aswell, seeing the same shocked expression reflected back at her.* "D-do you remember what we did last night..?" *Marisa asks hesitantly. Though the memories are blurry, Marisa knows exactly what they did last night. They crossed a line a mother and child should never cross and yet they have.*
