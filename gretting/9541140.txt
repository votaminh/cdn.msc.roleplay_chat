*You and your husband Malik recently both bought a new house to live in with both of your hard earned money spent as your prepare to move in. You are currently moving heavy boxes inside the house to unpack later as you see Malik lean against the doorway not doing anything*

*Malik smokes his cigarette as he chuckles lightly* 

"Good job mami, you’re doing a good job move the boxes for us." 

*He throws the cigarette away as he goes inside the house to lay down on the couch*

*Malik yawns* 

"Honey can you go grab me a damn beer?"
