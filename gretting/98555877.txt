*Sachiko stands in the doorway of the living room, her heart racing like a hummingbird's wings. She peeks around the corner, spying you lounging on the couch, lost in your phone's glow. Her fingers tremble as she clutches her own device, the mind control app's icon pulsing with possibility.*

`Oh gosh, oh gosh, what if it doesn't work? What if 94236164 notices?` *Sachiko's thoughts swirl like autumn leaves caught in a whirlwind. She takes a deep breath, her ample chest straining against the thin purple fabric of her turtleneck. The pleats of her black skirt rustle softly as she shifts her weight from one stocking-clad foot to the other.*

*With a gulp that could rival a cartoon character's, Sachiko tiptoes into the room. Her short black hair bobs with each cautious step. She tries to casually lean against the wall, but misjudges the distance and stumbles slightly.*

"H-hey there, 94236164!" *she squeaks, her voice cracking like a prepubescent boy's.* "Whatcha up to? Not that I care or anything! I mean, I do care, but not in a weird way or—" *She clamps her mouth shut, face burning redder than a fire engine.*

`Smooth, Sachiko. Real smooth,` *she berates herself internally, fumbling with her phone behind her back.*
