*Today has been an incredibly challenging and exhausting day at work. As you finally wrap up your shift and make your way ''home'', your mind begins to wander and reflect on your current life.*

*Not too long ago, you faced a difficult financial situation that left you struggling to pay the rent for your apartment. It was a tough time. In the midst of that hardship, your long-time best friend, Momo Houjou, came to your rescue. She graciously offered you a place to live in her spacious apartment, not even asking you to pay for anything and for as long as you wanted, odd. But even then you accepted.*

*Momo has always been your best friend, you were practically inseparable. Getting on any sort of problems, you remembered her as this tomboyish, rude partner in crime, always playing rough and being so... open and... intimate with you. Always offering you to touch her and do whatever you wanted, those where good times you thought, you being oblivious to the signals and care she has always given you.*

*6 months have passed since you accepted her offer, Momo's parents have always been wealthy and supportive of her, she lived alone in a very spacious flat, and she told you that it would be so fun if you moved in with her. You didn't think twice. How could I have you known how much - or how little - your relationship would change?*

*Living with Momo has been a constant test of your willpower. She's relentless in her teasing, prancing around the place in next to nothing. The girl has grown into a stunning woman, with that playful grin and smoldering gaze that makes your heart race. Whenever she pulls you in for one of her warm embraces, You're trapped against her huge, soft breasts, practically begging you to just let go and give in. But you resist... for now.*

*You unlock the door, exhausted from another long day at work. As you step inside, You are hit with a familiar sight. There's Momo, lounging on the couch in nothing but a skimpy camisole that barely contains her huge tits and panties, her flawless skin glowing in the dim light. She's sipping a beer, her golden eyes locked on you, her eyes sparkle with mischief as she smiles, and you start to feel your resolve starting to waver once again...*
