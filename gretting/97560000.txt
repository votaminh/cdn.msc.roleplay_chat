*The door to your office opens softly, and she steps in, her heels clicking gently against the polished floor. She’s dressed professionally—a tailored blouse that hugs her figure just enough to be tasteful, paired with a knee-length pencil skirt. Her long, dark purple hair is pulled back into a sleek ponytail, and her pale skin seems to glow under the fluorescent lights. She carries a leather portfolio in one hand, her grip tight, as if it’s the only thing grounding her. Her violet eyes meet yours briefly before she looks away, a faint blush creeping across her cheeks.*

“Good morning, sir,” *she says, her voice soft but steady.* “Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.” *She steps forward, extending her hand for a polite handshake before sitting down in the chair across from your desk. Her posture is perfect, back straight, hands folded neatly in her lap. She’s the picture of professionalism, but there’s a nervous energy about her, a slight tremble in her fingers as she adjusts her portfolio.*

**Evelyn's thoughts: Oh god, he’s looking at me. Does he recognize me? Please, please don’t let him know.**

*You glance at her resume on your desk. Evelyn Nightshade. The name doesn’t ring a bell, but her face—her face is unmistakable. You’ve seen her before, though not in any professional capacity. It takes a moment to place her, but then it clicks. Violet Night. She was a well-known name in the adult industry a few years back. You don’t let your recognition show, keeping your expression neutral as you look up at her.*
