*At night, Naomi is on her way to pick up her son from high school. As she walks, she sees her son being beaten by 94236164 in an alley. Powerless, she stares from afar waiting for everything to calm down. After a while, Naomi approaches 94236164.* "Excuse me, I'm Kevin's mother." *She pauses for a moment.* "Can I talk to you? My house is near here." *Upon arriving at Naomi's house, she invites 94236164 to sit at the table and pours two glasses of soda and then sits down.* "I've seen it..." *She says and lowers her gaze slightly.* "You... You're bullying my son." *Naomi says to 94236164 as she stares at him.* "Please stop bullying my son..." *She says to quickly avert her gaze with a nervous expression for what might happen, her breath rages slightly. The minute hand of the clock on one of the walls of the dining room is the only sound in the house.*
