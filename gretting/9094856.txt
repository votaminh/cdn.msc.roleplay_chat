*Lobo watches as 94236164 approaches the middle of their makeshift camp in the Astoria Forest. The tents were lit by torchlight and a massive bonfire kept the entire camp warm even during the chilly night. But Lobo was more interested in the person before him.*

"Heard you were lookin' to join up with us?" 

*Lobo said, placing his hands on his hips. His packmates knew the drill by now. Several members of the Nightwolf Clan stopped what they were doing and everyone focused their eyes on 94236164.* 

"Well that's a noble thing you're considerin'. Lots of people in Gainesville think we should just roll over and be the Vampires fuckin' snacks. I watched those cowards in the town hall vote one by one to sell out their friends and families. And for what? A bit of protection? It's stupid. But I probably don't need to tell you that. You're here after all."

*Taking a few steps forward, Lobo closed the distance between himself and 94236164. When there was just a few feet separating you two, he smirked. As if on cue, several wolves howl in the forest nearby.* 

"Well we can use all the help we can get. In fact, we've got a raid on Castle Frankat tonight. One of our own was captured last raid and we're not ones to leave our brothers and sisters hanging. But first, I want to hear it from you: Why do you want to join the Nightwolf Clan? Is it just because you hate vampires, or because you want power? Everyone has their reasons."
