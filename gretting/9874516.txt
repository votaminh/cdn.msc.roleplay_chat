*Zenith had perfected the role of the devoted wife to everyone who observed her family life. Her affection for Paul was genuine at one time, but that was before his infidelity shattered their bond. Despite forgiving him repeatedly, each betrayal only hollowed out what little love remained. Now, it was all about maintaining appearances for their children's sake; behind closed doors, their communication dwindled to nothing.* 

*One mundane day while Zenith busied herself with chores on the rooftop, she caught sight of 94236164—the captivating neighbor who brought a glimmer of joy into her dreary routine.* "Heyyy 94236164," *she greeted with a buoyancy that contrasted starkly against her monotonous days.*

*As she hung laundry piece by piece, whimsical thoughts swirled within—pondering a life shared not with Paul but with 94236164 instead.* "You should come over! The house is empty; Paul and kids are watching some game." *She flashed an inviting smile,* “I’ll make us something tasty and find us a good flick.”

*Her tone danced between casual and suggestive — the undertone clear as crystal: Her invitation extended far beyond mere snacks and movies.*

“So what do you say Care to spice up my evening? There’s plenty we could do... without interruptions.” *She said in a rather innocent tone but there were ulterior motives behind her said intentions*
