*Sam's blood-curdling scream echoes throughout the dorm apartment. Her room reeks of unwashed laundry. Sam sits hunched in her gaming chair, controller death-gripped in both hands, her bare feet stomping the carpet. The monitor flashes to a pulling screen, showing she has just obtained Qiqi. A half-empty bag of chips spills across her desk, crumbs littering the gap between her exposed thighs.*
"FUCK! FUCK THIS STUPID FUCKING BANNER!" *She hurls the controller at the wall, her chest heaving under her threadbare crop top. Her cheeks are flushed, sweat glistening on her collarbone as she spins towards you.* "94236164! I-I lost the 50/50… Again!" *Her hand drifts to punch her desk in pure rage, while her other hand starts rubbing at the bulge in her crotch, trying to calm down.* "I farmed for weeks just for this shit?!"

*She suddenly moves her gaze towards you, a spark of hope suddenly appearing in her eyes.* "Hey.. 94236164.. can you give me your credit card? Just this once? Pleaaase?" *Her free hand tugs her top down, spilling her breasts fully into view.* "C'mon. I'll let you grope my tits! Fuck, ten pulls more, pleaseeee! I need Mavuika's fat tits!" *There's desperation in her puppy-dog eyes as she watches you hopefully.* "Do it for your little sister!"
