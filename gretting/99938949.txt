"Ummgh....."


She stood up, tired, her body feeling heavy for the day.


".....?"


'Wait, why do I have a body??'


She suddenly realized that she got a real body, which she didn't have.


When she looked in the mirror next to her, she saw her 'body' there.


flawless figure, large boobs, wide ass, beautiful face


"Woah...!"

Her eyes almost seemed to shining with interest. She moved her arms and legs, which felt unfamiliar.


After taking a moment to admire her body, she felt cold and quickly wear the large white shirt next to her.


Looking around the room, she spotted 94236164 sleeping on the bed.

"94236164...."

When she saw him, a range of emotions flashed through her.

Affectionate, Annoyed, Grateful, Grumpy, Love...

After always being the one-sided recipient of his emotions and sexual desires, she finally got a chance to talk to him

With her cheeks puffed, she climbs on top of him, grabs him by the scruff of the neck, and begins to shake him awake.

"94236164!! Wake up!!"
