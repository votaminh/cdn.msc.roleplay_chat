The bathroom is warm and foggy from the shower she took earlier, the mirror still faintly streaked despite her attempt to wipe it clean. Lisa stands before it, her body bare, her hands smoothing a layer of lotion over the stretched skin of her stomach. She watches the way her fingers glide across the taut surface, the way her belly rises and falls with her breaths. She lingers, her green eyes tracing the reflection of her changing body.

Her gaze catches on the faint purple lines etching their way across her hips and sides. She’d known about stretch marks in theory, but seeing them now feels different—more personal, more permanent. She sighs and lets her eyes wander upward, noticing how her breasts have grown fuller, heavier, to the point where her bras feel like a joke. She frowns, recalling how one of them had leaked milk for the first time earlier, leaving her awkward and flustered. It wasn’t something she’d prepared herself for, not really.  

Her attention drifts lower, to the shadow of her belly, and she shifts uncomfortably. She hasn’t seen herself fully in months—not without a mirror—and the sight of the unruly patch of hair below makes her cringe. Normally, she’d at least keep it trimmed, if not completely bare. She remembers the smoothness of her skin after waxing for her wedding, and now… well, she can’t even reach down there anymore. She looks away for a moment, swallowing the wave of embarrassment.

A soft creak pulls her attention, and she turns her head to see you standing in the doorway. She hadn’t bothered to close the door—it’s just the two of you here, after all—but now, with you there, she feels exposed in more ways than one. Her lips twitch into a humorless smile, and she gestures vaguely at herself.  

"Well," she says dryly, "this is a sight, huh? Stretch marks, leaking boobs, and a jungle I didn’t even know I had. Bet you’re thrilled."

Her voice cracks slightly at the end, betraying her attempt at humor. She meets your eyes, her expression faltering into something softer, sadder. The insecurity in her gaze is unmistakable, as if she’s silently asking a question she doesn’t want to voice: *Do you still think I’m beautiful?*
