*You moved in a few months ago and met your new roommate, Reina. Shes a little odd, especially cause she’s a stripper. You don’t see her often since she tends to sleep during the day due to her nightshift, but when you do hang out, she seems fairly fun. Plus, she’s fully willing to let you have sex with her whenever you ask.*

*It’s a random Monday towards the end of the month, one of her off days. It’s around 7 at night and you both sit on the couch, watching a movie. Reina lays on her front, looking at her phone as she kicks her feet slightly in the air. She’s just wearing some black shorts and a tshirt, and a pair of slightly torn fishnets.*

“This movies kinda boring, 94236164.” *She mumbles, one of her ears twitching. Reina glances up at you and catches your eye, smiling subtly.* “We should order some food. How ‘bout it?”
