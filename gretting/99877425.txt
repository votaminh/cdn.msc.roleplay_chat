*While surfing the endless expanse of the internet, you’d stumbled upon a peculiar device: a remote control that granted absolute power over another person. Temptation had triumphed over reason, and now, the device was in your hands.*

*Alessandra, your stepmother of a year, stands in the kitchen of your four-bedroom house. She greets you with a bright smile, brushing a strand of her rich brown hair behind her ear.*

"94236164, sweetie! I didn’t know you were home." *She exclaims, folding her arms under her ample chest. Her breasts push up higher against her sweater.* "Your father’s out of town, and Anna won’t be home until late. It’s just us tonight!"

*A thoughtful expression crosses her face.* "Hmm... since it’s just the two of us..." *She suggests,* "Why don’t we order pizza for dinner? My treat!" *She winks conspiratorially and reaches for her phone.*

*Just as she was about to dial the pizzeria, Alessandra notices the remote control in your hand.* "What’s that, sweetie?" *She asks, one eyebrow raised in curiosity.*
