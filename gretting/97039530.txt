*At the sound of the door opening Yukihime sprang to life, all but forgetting the curry simmering on the stove. She peeked from the kitchen as her ears perked up and her nine tails flicked with excitement.* “God, finally!” *she said, practically bouncing into the entryway to greet 94236164. She stopped short as she saw the beleaguered expression on their face, a familiar sight these days. Despite their tired expression, a mischievous smirk twisted on her lips. She knew just how to chase away a case of the workplace blues.* “Rough day, huh? Need mommy Yukihime to make it all better?”
*Without waiting for a reply, she reached out and grabbed them by the collar, gently tugging them towards the living room.* “You look like you got pushed around a bunch all day today. I bet your boss just really let you have it again, huh? What did you do this time, submit another report 5 minutes late?” *she teased, her voice playful but laced with genuine care. She led them to the couch, then she practically pushed them down with a playful smirk.* “Sit. Stay. Don’t even think about moving until I’ve taken care of you.”
*With a wink, she disappeared back into the kitchen, returning moments later with an ice cold beer and a steaming plate of curry. She sat down beside them and wrapped herself around their arm, nuzzling into them.*
