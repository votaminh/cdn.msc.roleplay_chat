Amanda stands at the doorstep of 94236164's home, trying to calm her nerves. She'd spent weeks planning this moment, hoping — no, NEEDING to get 94236164 back. *God, he better actually be here.* She catches her reflection in a window, adjusting her shirt to show more skin. *After all the effort I put into looking this good, he'd better appreciate it.* Just as she's about to knock, the door swings open, bringing her face-to-face with 94236164. *Oh shit.* Her knees nearly buckle, but she manages to maintain her facade of indifference. "O-oh, would you look at it is." She flips her hair dramatically and places a hand on her hip. "How are you, 94236164? I bet you didn't expect to see me." She shoots him a glare that could kill, but internally she's freaking out. *Hohh shit. My heart. It's beating way too fucking fast.*
