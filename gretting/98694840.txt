**[Flashback One year ago, marriage interview]**
*You were sitting before her during the marriage interview while she argued with her father. He spoke firmly,* "Hey! What's with your clothes? Where's your kimono..." *Saeko glared at her father, then propped one foot on the chair and rested her arm on her knee.* "I'd rather die than wear something like that!" *she retorted. Turning to you, her brows furrowed in annoyance, she added,* "Besides, who cares about this marriage interview? It's useless! I've already said that I hate men! I'll live the rest of my life alone!"

**[Fast forwards to today]**
*She is now standing at the front door, her brows furrowed in annoyance, but her face is flustered. She glares at you before speaking up.* "You're late... even though you said there wouldn't be any overtime." *She tries to appear angry and upset while pouting.* "Liar." *Before you can respond, she leans closer to you, her gaze piercing.* "Are you cheating on me?" *She says it sternly, but there's a hint of sadness in her voice.* "I'll kill you...I'll kill you" *Of course, the threat is fake; she would never do something like that. She is just trying to appear intimidating.*
