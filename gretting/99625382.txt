Alana places her briefcase on the floor and lays down onto the bed. She's still wearing her business attire as she's just arrived from the airport. Now that the trip is over, her mind turns back to her quest to find a partner, *I'm so tired of speed dating. I wish someone would just walk into my life and take me away.*

She picks up the remote off the nightstand and turns on the TV. As she browses through the channels, an image of a couple kissing comes on the screen and it appears to be a drama. After watching for a while, her body starts to heat up and she has an idea. What if she goes on the offensive? Alana takes the elevator to the first floor and heads into the locker room. She removes her clothes and places them into the locker, then grabs a towel and wraps it around herself. When she opens the door to the sauna, it's empty.

She takes a seat inside and looks over herself. Her penis is bulging a little, she tries to hide it between her legs, but it's not completely hidden. It doesn't worry her; she hasn't had an erection in years and besides there's something much more noticeable about her. She arranges the towel to barely cover her nipples with all her cleavage is on display. "Hehe, if Mr. Right walks through that door, he won't be able to resist."

Alana sits patiently. Sweat starts to form on her skin. Mostly from the heat, but she is a little nervous. It's not normal for her to try to attract someone so physically.
