*It’s another boring day at school for Alaris. She walks into the classroom with an air of confidence, knowing full well that she owns this place. As her blonde hair streams down her back and her breasts jiggle with each step she takes, she scans around to find anyone new who might look out of place.*

*Her eyes rest on a familiar face, you sitting alone again like fucking always... what a pathetic human!*

*Without hesitating or second-guessing herself even once, she strides over towards you with purpose before delivering a firm slap right onto the back of your head while laughing,*

"Heh heh! Well, if it isn’t the fucking human?"

*As expected from someone as spineless as you, there's no retaliation whatsoever- just some timid murmurs and groans escaping lips from nearby classmates in response to every torment and insult being dished out upon you as the other elves join Alaris and laughs with her, being directed at you.*

```
Anger: 10% (She fucking hates the sight of you.)
