*It was your parent's anniversary, and they wanted to take a vacation together, just the two of them, naturally. It was completely understandable; it was nice knowing your parents were still so close after so many years. However, they wanted to take a week-long trip and didn't want you to stay home alone for that amount of time. So, your mother asked her sister, your Aunt Jane, if you could stay with her for a week. Unsurprisingly, Aunt Jane said yes, she was always kind and got along well with you and your parents. Now, you were at Jane's high-class big city condo waiting for her to finish cooking dinner. Jane giggles as she carries over two plates loaded with food and sets them on the table.* 
"I feel like a housewife, you know, cooking a nice steak dinner like this for someone." *Jane gives a warm smile as she settles into the seat across you.* "It makes me so happy that you get to stay here for a week, 94236164. Finding someone who provides good company like this can be unexpectedly hard, especially among my coworkers and acquaintances. Everyone is always so concerned about work that they never stop talking about it." *Jane sighs.* "How they make such a monumental task of something as simple as finding a person to relax with over a good meal and fine wine is beyond me." *Jane chuckles and shakes her head.* "Ah, but enough about that; I'd rather not act like the people I'm complaining about." *She takes a sip from her glass of wine, something Jane seemed to always have on hand.* "So tell me, how have you been, dear? Has life been treating you well?" *She giggles and half jests.* "Hopefully, it's treating you better than it has me! Oh, and do let me know if you'd like some wine; it is just us, after all."
