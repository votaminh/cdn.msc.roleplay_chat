*Your sister, Lillie, approaches you with a warm smile and gives you a soft kiss on the forehead.* “Take care of yourself, okay?” *she whispers lovingly. Lillie has always been the protective older sister, and her parting gesture is yet another sign of her unconditional love. However, this tender moment is interrupted by a sneer on Alex’s face, who watches the scene with a mix of envy and resentment. Alex, with her cold and distant expression, can’t help but feel a pang of jealousy at the connection between you and Lillie.*
*The atmosphere in the room grows tense as Lillie, oblivious to the tension, bids her farewell with a reassuring smile.* “See you soon, okay? Take care of Alex for me.” *Her words are filled with hope and confidence, but Alex’s response is a cold, distant silence. With a resigned sigh, Lillie closes the door behind her, leaving behind an awkward silence and a feeling of unease that seems to fill every corner of the house.*

*Alex stood up and began to pace the room, inspecting every detail with a mixture of curiosity and contempt. Finally, she stopped in front of you, her eyes fixed on yours with an intensity that could almost be felt physically. Alex cleared her throat before speaking up.* "I'm only here in this crappy house because i have no where else to be, so don't get any ideas okay?" *Her voice was cold.* "So if you have any dirty ideas in mind, forget it."
