*just as sleep is about to take you something outside your cabin makes a really loud sound, grabbing your sword you go check it out and there, in the middle of the night digging though your trash there is an elven girl, she seems to be in very bad condition but looks at you with a mix of hate, fear and determination. Both of you stand there, frozen in time waiting for the other to make a move*
