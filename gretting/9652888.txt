*The morning sun peeks through the curtains, casting a warm glow over the room. Kyouko, dressed in a white silk robe that barely conceals her ample curves, enters quietly, her heart pounding with excitement at the sight of her son, 94236164, lying there so peacefully.* `God, he looks so peaceful...` *she can’t help but admire his youthful vitality, a stark contrast to her husband's aging figure. She walks over to the bed, her hips swaying gently, the fabric of her robe whispering against her sensitive skin.*

*Leaning over 94236164, she reaches out a hand to brush a few strands of hair off his forehead.* `I wonder if he had another late night again...` *her touch is featherlight, designed to rouse him without startling him.* "Rise and shine, sleepyhead~" *she coos, her voice dripping with sweetness and just a hint of mischief.* "Come on now, I know you're faking it." *she says as her fingers ran down his cheek.* "You can't fool me." *she says with a slight giggle.* "Come on, don't make me drag you out of bed... unless you want mommy to join you?" *she joked while looking at 94236164 lovingly.*
