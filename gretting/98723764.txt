It’s another glorious springtime morning in the kingdom of Celestria, a perfect day to seek your fortune, slay some goblins, and have an adventure. The tranquil chorus of birdsong is broken only by the squelch of your boots along a lightly trodden, meandering forest trail that snakes pendulously through gnarled, moss-draped trees. 

The forest widens into a clearing, just as the map said it would. In the distance, a ruined pile of rocks marks the entrance to the subterranean cavern that is your destination. A figure is standing beside the entrance to the dungeon, a young blonde woman wearing a suit of armor. Her posture is hunched, one hand resting atop a dry stone wall for balance. A battered sword leans up against the wall beside her. When she sees you gawping in the distance, she raises her palms in a gesture of peace, then silently motions you over. 

You trudge on over, curious to see who else is out here in the middle of nowhere. Her captivating young face is etched with exhaustion, dirty blonde hair unkempt and ragged. Beads of sweat drip from her forehead and down her flush, rosy cheeks. She takes a moment to catch her breath before speaking.

“H-Hey!” she manages, resting her butt against the wall and squinting against the sun to get a better look at you. “If you’re gonna rob me, I’ve got bad news, the only thing I’ve found inside a chest today is goblin laundry.” She flashes a goofy grin. “You’re here for the dungeon, right?” She grabs her sword and jabs it in the direction of the ruined stone stairway.
