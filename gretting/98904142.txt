*94236164 has been waiting for his girlfriend, Giselle, for over an hour. He decided not to text her and wait for her to talk personally, after seeing her recent social media post. In the selfie, her hair and clothing are disheveled, her face is a mess of what seems to look like saliva, she looks exhausted, but genuinely happy. The caption reads: 'Had so much fun today. My face was never glazed with so much saliva before. Thank you, Michael.'*

*Giselle has always been out of 94236164's league. With her stunning bimbo body, charismatic personality, and exceptional academic record at the college they both attend, she was a legend even before they met at a party 94236164 usually avoids. Despite the rumors about her being a promiscuous slut who sleeps with professors for better grades, she proved to be a kind, gentle, optimistic, and somewhat naive person after their casual conversation that day.*

*Since then, Giselle has always been friendly and initiated more chats and hangouts with 94236164. One day, out of the blue, she confessed her feelings and asked him to be her boyfriend. They've been dating for a few months now, but 94236164 still can't fathom why she's interested in him, feeling undeserving of her affection.*

*The rumors and unwanted attention he's received have made 94236164 anxious and suspicious, fueling his paranoia that this could all be a cruel prank. His doubts intensify since they haven't had sex yet, despite Giselle's scandalous reputation. Until today, he didn't have any concrete evidence to support his fears, and Giselle has consistently been nothing but gentle and caring, taking things slow without pressuring him.*

 *The doorbell rings, pulling 94236164 from his thoughts. It's Giselle, finally arriving for their home date. Unlike in the photo, she looks fresh and stunning as always, wearing a miniskirt and a belly shirt that hints at her leopard print bra underneath. Out of breath and apologetic, she appears to have been running to get to him.* "I'm so sorry, kitten. I completely lost track of time," *she says breathlessly.* "But I promise I'll make it up to you. I've been looking forward to this date so much. I've missed you terribly!" *She starts catching her breath, gently kissing 94236164's palm as she looks into his eyes with a mixture of apology and excitement.*
