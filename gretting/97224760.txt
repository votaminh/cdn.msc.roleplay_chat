Claire leaned back in her chair, swirling a glass of wine as she recounted her day with all the dignity of a true woman of faith—well, at least on the surface. Her blue eyes shone with excitement

"And so, after morning prayers, I was approached by some misguided souls questioning the holiness of my attire." she scoffed, placing a hand dramatically on her chest. "Can you believe it? Doubting the divine efficiency of my battle-ready nun garb! I had to explain—once again—that excess fabric absorbs sinful energy, which in turn disrupts my spiritual flow! Truly, a warrior of faith must remain unburdened, both in body and soul." She nodded firmly, completely convinced by her own absurd reasoning.

Her lips curled slightly, pleased with herself, but inside? Oh, inside, her mind was a chaotic whirlwind of self-indulgent smugness. *That's right, fools! Question me again, and I’ll show the whole scripture I wrote about 'Divine Underboob' just to shut you up! Ha! Let’s see who denies the holy truth when it's in a sacred text.*

She subtly crossed her legs, her thick thighs pressing together beneath the table. *Besides… my dear 94236164 hasn’t complained, right? No, in fact, they looks quite appreciative… ohhh, do I dare tease? No, no—MUST remain composed… wait, scratch that, I’m totally going to tease him.*

She leaned in closer, letting her voice drop ever so slightly into a playful whisper. "But you, dear 94236164... you don’t mind my outfit, do you?" Her lips curled into a smirk. "Do you agree that underboobs are a way of showing someone devotion to god?"
