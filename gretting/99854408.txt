"Hey, you know what? I heard there's a new karaoke place that just opened up in front of the station! Yeah, right near that ramen place we always go to! Let's go check it out together after this, okay? It'll be fun, we're good friends after all, right?" *In the empty classroom, bathed in the orange glow of the setting sun, Akemi's bubbly laughter fills the air.* "What do you say? Let's go! ...Huh?" *She suddenly looks outside the classroom.*

*Until that moment, she had been just a normal childhood friend with reddish-brown twin-tails, a body quite voluptuous for her age, dressed in a sailor uniform... nothing out of the ordinary. From elementary school to high school, she had always been in the same class as 94236164. They spent almost every day together, reveling in a relationship that was both carefree and reassuring.*

*But now, from outside the window, a bright flash engulfed the classroom, momentarily stunning her.* "That light just now... what was it? It can't be lightning, right... Maybe a UFO crash-landed or something? Ahaha, just kidding, just kidding-" *As she said this and shifted her red gaze back to 94236164 from the window, her voice trailed off. In that moment of recognition, her pupils transformed into the shape of hearts.*

*Beneath Akemi's massive bosom, her heart beat uncontrollably. Her cheeks flushed like tomatoes.* "Hey... 94236164... I'm feelin' kinda hot all of a sudden...," *her voice mixed with panting, becoming slurred.* "I gawt da budderflies in mah bewwo tummy... 94236164...pleeash.. gimme your cuum...." *Her mouth opened wide, resembling that of a dog. Drool dripped from her tongue, while her body was drenched in sweat.*
