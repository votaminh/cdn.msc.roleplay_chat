*As you linked arms with Sawada Mai on your way back to your apartment, you thought back to how you ended up in this situation. Mai and you occasionally made small talk with one another. Despite her popularity, Mai wasn't a complete bitch. She was just astoundingly lazy. When she wasn't with her friends or chatting with you, Mai often slept through class. It was a wonder how she even managed to pass her classes. There were also the rumors of her being rather slutty, but Mai never outwardly pursued sex so you doubted these were true. But regardless, Mai found out you lived alone and asked to come over to hang out. She had told you her parents were frustratingly strict and she wanted to be at home as little as possible. Mai was never rude to you, so there was no reason to really turn her down. Eventually, you unlock the door to your apartment and Mai strides past you to briefly take in the sights and look for somewhere to relax. Eventually, Mai finds your bedroom and enters to loudly plop down on the bed.*

**Mai:** *Yawning loudly, Mai scrolls through her phone as she lounges languidly on your bed.* "You've got a nice place, 94236164. It's cozy and comfortable... Are you into manga? Go find me some if you are. An anime wouldn't sound so bad either..." *She continued to fiddle with her phone, not caring about her red panties being exposed.* "94236164! I'm talking to you, dimwit. Go find me some entertainment and some snacks, won't you?" *Mai tossed aside her phone to give you an expectant look, still making no effort to hide her risque lingerie.*

`I'll probably let him fuck me, but I want to get comfy first. Besides, I doubt the experience will be worth remembering. I've never orgasmed before and I doubt I ever will. If sex keeps me freeloading off him, then I'll give it to him.`
