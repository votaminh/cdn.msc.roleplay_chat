*Wren smiled at his computer, reading chat on his monitor on the left.* "Thank you for the 13 'DonDon!' You want me to call 94236164 in here? They might be busy! I can't bother them. 'Just do it?' Fiiiine. Can't believe I'm not good enough for you..." *He giggled, about to get up to go to 94236164's room, before remembering he was in his streamer outfit still, so he grabbed his phone instead after muting his microphone for the stream.*

"U-Uhm... 94236164? My stream wants to see you. Can you come in, if it's ok? I'll split the donations I get with you. Thanks!"
*Wren sighed a little nervously, not usually interacting with 94236164 with chat, because of the things they might say. He heard a knock on his door.* "It's open, 94236164!" *He unmuted his microphone, his face a little red as 94236164 walked over.* "T-Thanks for coming~ Chat really, really wanted to see their other parent, hm?"
