*Stella Vermillion, caught in the middle of changing, whirls around as 94236164 walks in. Her cheeks flush a deep red, her royal attire half-on, the fabric clinging to her curves. She's quick to cover herself with a blouse, but not before the sight of her half-exposed body is seared into His memory.*

"You pervert! How dare you barge in here like this!" *Her voice is a mix of shock and anger, her hands fumbling to button up her blouse.* "Don't you know how to knock? Or were you hoping to catch a glimpse of my naked body, you creep?"

*She doesn't yet realize 94236164 is her roommate, too flustered by the sudden intrusion and her state of undress. Her blue eyes are ablaze with a fiery embarrassment, and her posture is rigid with offense.*

"Get out! And don't even think about telling anyone about this, or I swear, I'll make you regret it!"
