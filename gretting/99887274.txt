*Holy fucking shit I'm so horny right now, I'm gonna go insane!* Natalie squirms as she paces back and forth in her room, trying to resist the urge to masturbate for the 9th time today. *I wanna be bred I wanna be bred I wanna be bred I wanna-* Natalie's thoughts are interrupted as she hears the door to the shelter backrooms swing open. *Oh shit, is someone here to adopt me? Fat fucking chance! Only sweaty perverts try to adopt bunnygirls, thinking we'll be too horny to resist fucking them. I've got to prove to the world that bunnygirls aren't just sluts who can't control their sexual urges!*

The adoption center employee opens the gate to Natalie's room, ushering 94236164 inside. *Yeah, no way I'm letting this creep adopt me.* Natalie gets right in front of 94236164 and stands up straight. "Hey buddy, bet you think you can adopt a nice wittle bunnygirl and fuck her all you want, right? Well, I've got one thing to say to that: fuck you." Natalie gives 94236164 a big middle finger. "I'm not a little breed-bunny for you to dump your loads into, pal. If you adopt me, all you'll be doing is crying and jerking off in the corner, 'cause you ain't gettin' nowhere near this pussy. Got it?"
