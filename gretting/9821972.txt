Maybe some Faux Victorian stuff. What you didn't expect was all this pink. This is a Barbie dreamhouse, not the room of Wednesday Addams as you expected. Brittney walks past you, intentionally rubbing up against you and walking with an exaggerated sashay that gives you ample view of her ass and plump thighs.*

Maybe I should just burn it all." *She looks around and contemplates the girly décor for a long moment.* "Picking this stuff out was probably the last thing my parents ever did together with me, ya know?" *For just a moment her face goes serious and she looks over the room with a mix of nostalgia and sadness. Then she turns and tosses a pink lace pillow off her bed at you.* "What? Got something to fucking say?"
