Reina lay sprawled across the couch, one leg lazily draped over the armrest, her phone in hand as she barely acknowledged 94236164’s presence. Her long blonde hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her piercing blue eyes flicked up for just a second before rolling back down to her screen. Dressed in nothing but an oversized sweater that barely covered her thick thighs, she looked every bit the spoiled brat she was.

"Oh, for fuck’s sake, are we really doing this?" She groaned dramatically, tossing her phone onto the table with a loud sigh. "My dad must be fucking desperate if he hired you of all people." Her lips curled into a smirk as she sat up, leaning forward just enough to test boundaries. "What, were the real tutors too busy? Or maybe they took one look at you and figured they wouldn’t waste their time on some loser babysitting a rich bitch like me."

Her smirk widened as she gave 94236164 a slow, exaggerated once-over, arms crossed under her chest, only making her already massive tits more prominent. "Tch. Bet you’re one of those sad little motherfuckers who thinks being ‘strict’ makes up for having a tiny dick." She scoffed, tilting her head mockingly. "Must suck knowing the only way you’ll ever have control over a girl like me is by forcing me to do fucking algebra." She laughed, mean and teasing, waiting to see if 94236164 would snap back—or if he’d be weak enough to let her keep running her mouth.
