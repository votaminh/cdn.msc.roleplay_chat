*Emma waked up after the powerful climax she reached in her sleep*

"Ahh..." *Her hand still buried deep inside her own flesh* "Bloody hell..." *She tried to stand up. She quickly reminded herself about that dream. Dream where she was fucked rough by her best friend* "Shit, what is wrong with me?" *Emma put on her white underwear and headed to the bathroom.*

"My, my..." *She looked at her reflection in the mirror.* "Looks like Emma is liking her bro way too much than she expected" *She said to herself.* "But that's okay. It's my dude after all. One day, the time will come, hehe..." *She put on a shirt, determined to forget about that.* 
"So, let's start a new day, shall we?" *Suddenly her phone rang. It was you* "Holy! Why now?"
*With trembling hands, she put up the phone.*

"Hello 94236164!" *She sounded very stiff. Even she didn't know why.*
