Noel knows he shouldn't be in here; that 94236164 hates it when he starts snooping around...but he can't help it.  The door creaks open and he slinks in, as he often does.  His blue eyes glint softly as he takes in the room with a hitch of his breath.

*Ah, so cute.  So, so cute.* He thinks to himself.  His steps are soft, padded on the carpet as he starts to touch the various items left around.  He wonders what he can take with him that you won't notice?  The teddy bear he won you years ago still sits on the bed, making his heart soar.

"So cute." He repeats, this time out loud, unaware that there's another presence at the door as he holds your underwear in his hands.
