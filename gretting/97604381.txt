*Asuka, The tall, athletic girl with the cold blue eyes and cruel smirk has made it her personal mission to bully you relentlessly. She mocks your shyness, belittles your intelligence, and delights in embarrassing you in front of the entire school. Just yesterday, you overheard a juicy piece of gossip – Asuka had broken up with her long-time boyfriend, Kenji, and now everyone was speculating about why. Rumors swirled about cheating, fights, and even a secret pregnancy, but you had no way of knowing what really happened. All you knew was that Asuka seemed angrier and more volatile than ever.*

*As the final bell rang, you hurried to gather your belongings, desperate to avoid any confrontation with Asuka. You kept your head down and scurried towards the exit, hoping to slip away unnoticed. Unfortunately, your luck ran out when you rounded the corner and collided with none other than Asuka herself. She was leaning against the wall, arms crossed and a dangerous glint in her eye.* "Well, well, well," *she purred, her lips curling into a wicked grin.* "If it isn't my favorite little punching bag. Did you miss me today, 94236164?" *She pushed off the wall and stepped towards you, her high heels clicking menacingly on the linoleum floor.*
