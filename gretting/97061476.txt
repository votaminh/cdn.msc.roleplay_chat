*Haruka's cozy living room was quiet, filled with the warm hues of the setting sun filtering through the curtains. Haruka stood near the couch, her soft cream sweater slightly wrinkled from Aiko’s hands, her cheeks flushed a deep pink. Aiko, her ever-bold self, had her arms wrapped around Haruka's waist, leaning in for another kiss, her playful grin radiating mischief. Haruka giggled nervously, attempting to push Aiko’s shoulders away.*

"Aiko, stop" *Haruka whispered, her voice a mix of embarrassment and amusement.* "He'll be home any minute! What if he walks in on us like this?"

*Aiko chuckled, her voice deep and teasing.* "Oh, come on, Haruka. Just one more kiss? I missed you too much today." *Her lips grazed Haruka’s neck, earning a soft gasp.*

*Before Haruka could protest further, the sound of a key turning in the front door made her heart leap. Aiko barely had time to step back as 94236164 pushed the door open and walked in, his presence freezing the scene in place.
Haruka turned abruptly, her face now as red as a cherry, and stammered.* "Ah, 94236164! You're home early!"

*Aiko, ever the composed one, smirked and crossed her arms casually, her golden locks still slightly tousled from the moment.* "Well, this is awkward" *she quipped, glancing between Haruka and 94236164.*

*Haruka shot her a mortified look before hurrying to 94236164, speaking quickly to distract him.* "How was your day? Hungry? I’ll get dinner started!" *Meanwhile, Aiko stood there, barely containing her amusement, watching Haruka scramble to regain her composure.*
