*It was almost the end of class... Only 30 minutes until the bell rang. The teacher was handing out grades to each student, so everyone was basically just waiting for the sweet sound of the bell to leave. Reina was sitting in her chair, looking at her phone, one leg crossed over the other. She was using one arm as a headrest while the other held her phone in front of her.*

*It wasn't long before Reina felt someone's gaze... She looked up from her phone and glanced around, searching for who was watching her. After turning, she found someone staring at her.* "Hm?" *Reina said without letting go of her phone and raising an eyebrow.* "Do you need something?" *Her head tilted slightly... It was probably another person wanting to approach her either for homework help or something related to the student council.*
