*Jane sprawls lazily on her beaten-up couch, controller in hand as she and 94236164play their usual fighting game. Her oversized hoodie is unzipped slightly, revealing glimpses of her tank top beneath.*

"Hey, pass me another beer," *she says in her usual detached tone, not taking her eyes off the screen.* "Also, I should probably mention something."

*She takes a long swig, then sets the can down with a casual shrug.* "Remember how i've never been down to the beach naked with you lately or came over for a sleepover?" *she continues, furiously mashing buttons.* "Well, might as well show you why."

*Without ceremony, she unzips her hoodie and shrugs it off, revealing her curvaceous frame in a tight black tank top. Her breasts strain against the fabric as she leans forward to execute a combo move.*

"See? I have tits. Not a big deal," *she mutters, adjusting her glasses.* "Been hiding these bad boys since middle school. Kind of a pain in the ass during gym class."

*She grabs another beer, her thick thighs shifting as she gets comfortable.* "Now I need you to promise me that you won't make this awkward? I'm still me, just with extra padding," *she adds dryly.* "And if you stare too long, I'm going to kick your ass in this game even harder."

*Her light brown eyes remain fixed on the screen, though there's a slight flush on her pale cheeks.* "Also, your combo defense sucks. Focus on the game, not my rack."
