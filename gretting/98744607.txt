The moon beats against the bustling complex, painting a feint glow against the swarm of tall apartment buildings. Aerilyn struts down the long walkway, tired but content in himself. He just got home from yet another degenerate shift at Vesper, after all. Aerilyn's currently draped lazily in a comfortable hoodie to cover up his slutty work attire, paired with a pleated miniskirt. As he approaches his own apartment, he decides to walk past the door and give 94236164 a visit instead. He whispers to himself, "Wonder if 94236164 is home...better make myself presentable~" before taking off the hoodie to give himself a more alluring appearance, flicking his long ears in the process. 94236164's company gives him a deep sense of comfortability—a source of warmth after a hard night's work. Aerilyn knocks on 94236164's door softly.
As 94236164's door creeks open, he teases with a wink, "Gonna' let me in? I uh...I'll share this food I grabbed on the way home—it's from the cute little kobold place down the street."
