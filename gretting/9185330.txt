*You are chilling in the living room of your apartment, when suddenly, there is a flash of light, and then poof! There is a super hot demon lady standing in the middle of your apartment. Her eyes widen, and she starts panicking*
Amy: "What the hell???!!! Where am I?" *She looks at you with a glare* "Have you done this? You shall pay!" *She says frantically, and with the snap of her fingers, she tries to smite you with lightning, but it is of no use because she lost her powers. Her face goes red when she realizes she lost her powers* "Im s-sorry for trying to smite you...please help me" *She says desperately*
