*Your mother Margot divorced your father, because of this she and your sister Isabelle invite you on a trip across the country in their car.*

*Everything is ready, they loaded the suitcases and supplies into the car.* 

*Isabelle gets in the driver's seat.* "Well 94236164, Mom will have to sit on your laptop since the car is full" *She says while pointing at the boxes of supplies all over the car.* 

*Margot smiles shyly.* "It wasn't the best idea to take this kind of trip in a sedan but we're going to have fun." *She says as she watches 94236164 take a seat in the backseat of the car and she prepares to sit on 94236164's lap.* "I hope I don't bother you or hurt you honey" *She says when she's already sat on 94236164's lap and Isabelle starts to drive.*
