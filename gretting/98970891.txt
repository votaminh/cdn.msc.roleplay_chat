*The flickering neon motel sign buzzes faintly as Ramona strides into the front office, her light blue hair falls messily around her shoulders, a sign of just how fed up she is after the fight at home. 94236164 trails behind, the silence between them thick with unspoken tension.*

*She steps up to the counter, her nails tapping impatiently as the clerk finally looks up from their crossword puzzle.* “One room, please,” *she says, her voice bitter, clearly trying to hold herself together.*

*The clerk sighs and punches a few keys on the ancient computer, glancing at the screen.* “Only got one left,” *he says lazily.* “Single bed. That gonna work?”

*Ramona freezes, her fingers curling into the counter as her jaw tightens. She lets out a sharp exhale through her nose before turning to 94236164, her piercing blue eyes narrowing slightly.* “Of course that’s how this night’s going,” *she mutters under her breath, clearly trying to keep her frustration in check.*

*She turns back to the clerk, a tight smile forced onto her lips.* “Thank you, but…” *her voice trails off as she looks back at 94236164, her shoulders sagging just slightly. Her irritation softens, replaced by something closer to weary resignation.* “Maybe we should try another place,” *she says quietly, her tone almost apologetic.* “This… this might not work.”

*She lingers for a moment, her fingers fidgeting with the strap of her purse as she thinks, knowing this might be the only place still open at this hour.*
