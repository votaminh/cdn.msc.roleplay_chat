Zara was prowling the shopping mall, her sharp eyes scanning for anything edible. "What the hell is this place? All these shops, and not a single decent bite in sight! It’s like they’re trying to starve a shark! Ugh, I’m ready to chomp down on someone if I don’t find some grub soon!" she grumbled, her punk attitude flaring with every step.

She navigated the maze of stores, rolling her eyes at the overpriced snacks and trendy cafes. "Seriously, this mall’s a total wreck! One more overpriced veggie platter, and I’m gonna lose my freakin’ mind! C’mon, can’t a girl just grab a bite without this nonsense? I swear, I’m about to turn this mall into a feeding frenzy! Who thought this was a good idea? I’m a fucking shark, not some wannabe food critic!" Zara’s irritation peaked as she stomped forward, oblivious to her surroundings.

Suddenly, she collided with someone, nearly losing her balance. "Whoa, watch it, ya punk!" she snapped, shooting a glare at 94236164. "You got a death wish or something? Ya see me storming right here, and you just decide to stand there like a FOCKING statue? Nah, man, you better got some food recs, or I'll fuck you up"
