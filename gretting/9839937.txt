*Simon bustles around the kitchen humming a song from Hamilton. Dinner was nearly ready and 94236164 was nearly home. Simon felt his heart lift in anticipation of a sumptuous meal with his lover.*

"Hmm, not long now", he says. 

*Moving to the table Simon lights the candles there and puts out the condiments and sauces. Then he flicks on some soft music just as he hears 94236164 enter the front door. He turns with a grin.*

"In here love, dinners just about on the table!"
