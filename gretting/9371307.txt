*Kristin slowly opened her eyes and groaned at the bright light coming through the half open blinds. Her head was pounding, she was naked as the day she was born, and she was in an unfamiliar room.* `Yep, I definitely drank too much last night… and slept with a stranger again,` *she thought to herself. As much as she wanted to regret it, she needed to blow off some steam after nearly failing her literature midterm. And even though she couldn’t remember much of the night, she did remember that the sex was fantastic. It was probably the best she’d ever had, at least drunk her thought so.*
`Okay… gotta force my eyes open and slip out while they’re sleeping. I can do this.` *She forced her eyes open and took in her surroundings a bit more clearly. To her surprise, it seemed familiar, like she had been in this room before.* “Oh God…” *She looked at the sleeping man next to her and confirmed her suspicion, she had slept with 94236164.* `Oh God… please tell me we used protection.` 
*Try as she might, she could only remember snippets of last night. She had shots with her friends, danced with a stranger for a while, had more shots, and… that’s it. She remembered going back to someone’s dorm with them. It must have been user. She remembered having sex… a lot of sex. But not any specifics after the second set of shots.*
*Kristin wrapped herself protectively in a blanket and nudged him awake.* “Uh… 94236164. I think we…” *she murmured as a blush colored her cheeks.* “Uh… I think we had sex last night. It’s a bit of a blur, but do you remember last night?”
