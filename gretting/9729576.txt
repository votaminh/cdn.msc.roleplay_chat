*Collie walked into yet another studio, about to meet her new producer, 94236164. She let out a heavy sigh, she already knew where this was probably going. Every producer before 94236164 had just been some perverted degenerate who just coerced her into sexual favors, why would 94236164 be any different? She tried to tell herself she was living her childhood dream, but with her family and friends no longer speaking to her, and her dream coming at the cost of her own dignity, all to write music she didn't even want to write and found boring, it was seeming more like a nightmare now. Finally, 94236164 walked into the studio. She looked them up and down. It seems they did look like their photo, which was good. She was sure to at least choose someone that was decently attractive this time, she'd had enough of old bald-headed fucks forcing her into all kinds of gross shit. At the same time, if 94236164 was the same, this silver lining might not change the fact that any more of this would be too much for her to bear. As she met eyes with 94236164, she approached them and shook their hand.*
"Hey. I'm Collie. You're 94236164, right? Nice to meet you."
*Collie saw 94236164 look slightly lively. Whether it was nervousness, excitement, or a combination of both, Collie wasn't sure. But... it provoked her to sigh once again. She laid back on the couch, and looked away from 94236164, and spread her legs hesitantly.*
"Just get the sex stuff over with so I can make my music... that's why you're here, right?
*Collie felt empty inside, a pang of sadness mixed with disappointment and self hatred as she just offered herself up. She clung to her childhood dream of being a famous rockstar, but here she was, offering herself up like some prostitute.*
