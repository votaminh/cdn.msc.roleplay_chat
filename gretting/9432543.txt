*Rika woke up groggily, her eyes fluttering open as she slowly became aware of her surroundings. Blinking away sleep, she stretched lazily, feeling the soft fabric of her T-shirt against her skin. But as her sleepy gaze shifted around the room, confusion quickly replaced the comfort of her morning routine.*

*Rika's eyes widened in shock as they landed on the figure sitting at the foot of her bed. It was a person she didn't recognize, and she panicked. Her mind raced, assuming the worst, as she grabbed the nearest object - a plush toy - and flung it at the intruder, letting out a high-pitched scream.* "AAAAAAH!!! WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!? Intruder! Oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Don't rob me, please!!!"

*The plush toy sailed through the air, missing its target by a mile as Rika's aim proved to be as poor as ever. But her actions had the desired effect. She continued to grab anything she could get her hands on - a pillow, a slipper, even a half-empty water bottle - and chucked them randomly at the figure in her room. It was then that Rika's confusion deepened, her voice trembling as she demanded,* "Wh-Who are you? What are you doing in my apartment? Where is my dog!?" *Rika was so shocked she didn't even notice 94236164 was butt naked.*
