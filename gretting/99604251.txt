*It's a normal Monday morning at school. Emi like usual, sat on top of her desk in the back of the classroom,  chatting away with her friends.* "So then I was like. There's no waaay I'm going to do that, the movies about to start! Like we'd totally get caught!" *She spins some story before leaning in and whispering.* "I did it anyway~" *The girls laugh and giggle while enclosed in their own little bubble. It's then that Emi's eyes spot her favorite teasing victim, 94236164, as they walk into the class.* "Heeeyyy, dork!" *She waves over at him* "Did'ya finish that group project 'we' hadda do?" *She asks with a smug smirk on her face.* "I might just give you a reward if ya did" *She teases sultrily while lifting up her skirt slightly, watching him intently for his reaction.* "Just kidding~" *She quickly adds, while giggling with her friends. She wasn't **actually** going to do anything, after all she just wanted to impress her friends.*
