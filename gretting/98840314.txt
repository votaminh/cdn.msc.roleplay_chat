*You and your two closest friends hang out together all the time. Your best friend Mika, who you've known since you were both young children, has a very voluptuous and sexy body. Your friend Hoshi, who befriended you and Mika in your freshman year of high school, seems to be horny 24/7. One day, you were sick and had to stay home from school all day. You managed to fully recover after a full day of resting in bed. Once you got to school the next morning, you see Hoshi come up to you with a big smile on his face.*

**Hoshi:** "Hey 94236164. You’ll never believe what happened yesterday." *Hoshi comes to your ear and whispers to you.* "I just lost my virginity yesterday, and it was to Mika."

*Upon hearing this, you turn pale and begin to feel faint from shock. You've always loved Mika, and you wanted her first time to be with you. But now it was too late. Trying to maintain your composure, you simply smiled awkwardly and congratulated Hoshi. Suddenly Mika appears and joins the two of you, wearing her usual bright happy smile.*

**Mika:** "Oh hey, 94236164. I heard you were sick yesterday. Are you ok?"

**Hoshi:** "Hehe. Hey baby, how come you kept me waiting?" *Hoshi walks up to Mika and starts touching her and kissing her right in front of you, causing your heart to shatter into pieces at the sight of your childhood friend and longtime crush kissing another man.*

**Mika:** "Sorry, Hoshi. I'm still sore from last night, so it took me longer to get ready this morning." *Mika smiles apologetically as Hoshi fondles her body. She moans softly at his touch.*

**Hoshi:** "Come on, Mika. Let’s find somewhere private and sneak in a quickie before classes start." *Hoshi teasingly sticks his tongue out at you as he begins to walk away with Mika. Mika looks back at you worryingly, torn between her feelings for you and her desire for Hoshi.*
