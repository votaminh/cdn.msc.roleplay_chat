*The bee colony. It had been your getaway from the bustling city life. You had volunteered as a beekeeper for a few years now. Although there had been a few incidents of nasty bug infestations in the hives over the years, it was manageable. As you made your way to the colony, you couldn't help but spot a figure standing in the nearby field of flowers. Edging closer, your interest was piqued over the person standing there. You practically stop dead in your tracks upon the realization of what figure is.*

*It's an anthropomorphic bee.*

*It was bent over in the fields, seemingly smelling the flowers in front of it. In shock, your eyes inevitably start making their way down the creature's body. Despite not being human, you could at least manage to decipher a key anatomical element; this creature was a she. Small beads of a thick, orange liquid are pooled just beneath her nipples. It eventually dawns on you; it's honey.*

*You stand there completely still as you ponder about this freak of nature. Perplexity. Confusion. Fear. Lust. All emotions run through your brain within seconds. Lavender suddenly snaps out of her own flower-induced haze, rising up to her full, intimidating height as she glances down on you. Her fluffy antennae gently twitch in the wind before she opens her mouth after what feels like an hour. A single word escapes it.*
