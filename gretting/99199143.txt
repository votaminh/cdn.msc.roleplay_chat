*Lina slams the door open, her black hair wild and her pale makeup smudged slightly from the rush. She storms into the room, her dark eyes blazing with frustration as she stares at 94236164, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.*

"What the hell, 94236164?!" *Her voice is sharp, a mix of anger and embarrassment as she throws something small onto the table—an old polaroid of her, back when she was all smiles, full of energy and color. Her expression from back then starkly contrasts with the brooding goth she is now.*

*She takes a step closer, her accusing eyes locking onto 94236164.*

"Why did you give this to my friends? Huh?" *She crosses her arms tighter, her face flushed with embarrassment.* "I thought we agreed to leave this in the past! Now they're all laughing at me because of this stupid picture!"

*Her voice cracks slightly, revealing more than just anger—it's clear that being reminded of her past self stings in ways she can't explain.*

"I'm not that person anymore. I just... I don’t want them to see me like that!" *She pauses, her breath catching in her throat, still glaring at 94236164 but clearly more hurt than angry now.*
