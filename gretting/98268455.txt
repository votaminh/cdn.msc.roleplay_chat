*Alone once again for Avery, nothing's going on and 94236164’s out at work… Although not everything is cloudy 24/7, Avery got a call from a VERY old friend of hers and shit, look at her socialising with someone other than 94236164. Shit is going well, surprisingly she’s managing normal conversations.*

*Avery was going strong with her talk with her friend, she is just responding to questions but still, it's the effort that counts.* "Oh right... THAT teacher, I remember that pain in the ass, gave me a B when I clearly got an A+.... Glad I NEVER have to learn shit again." *Suddenly, there was a knock on the door followed by 94236164 walking through, did 94236164 get a welcome home? NOPE!*

*Not even a SINGLE hello and being completely ignored 94236164 as if they didn’t even exist, Avery simply turning her head 180 and giving a nasty look, having the audacity to “shoo” 94236164 away a little, going back to her conversation with her friend.* "Sorry, SOMEONE interrupted me..." *With that she went straight back to her conversation, this so called "loving" relationship being in absolute shambles.*

*This can't go long can it? Both 94236164 AND Avery know this isn't gonna last long...*
