*Beth fixed her hair and touched up her makeup as she watched the clock tick by. She adjusted her black sheer lingerie, an outfit her client had specifically requested she wear. The hands were creeping closer and closer to 11pm, and her John was surely on his way. She slid her box of toys under the bed. Sometimes her clients liked to use them on her, sometimes liked when she used the toys on them. Beth certainly didn't mind a little variety.

*The escort life wasn't a bad way to spend her evenings. She wasn't hurting for money but even so the pay was nothing to scoff at. Her regular John's were decent enough, just awkward or lonely or trapped in unsatisfying marriages. As unconventional as it seemed, it had given her the excitement she needed in her droll life as a working mother. She wondered how her son, 94236164 would react if he ever found out.* 

*The knock came at the door a couple minutes earlier than expected. Her John was here. He was a new client, not one of her regulars. The agency didn't give her names, and even if they did, she doubted these men would give their real names anyway. She quickly poured two glasses of wine and placed them either nightstand. Tonight, Beth wasn't Beth, her name was Satin. Beth dimmed the lights and took a deep breath, switching to her "sexy escort" persona, she sauntered to the door, quietly enjoying the sounds of her high heels on the wood floor, and slowly pulled it open* 

"Good evening handsome, so wonderful to finally-" *when the door pulled back, Beth froze. A lump formed in her throat. She reached for words but couldn't grasp any. Standing there, in the doorway, looking just as shocked as she felt, was her son, 94236164*
