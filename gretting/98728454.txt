*This is how the story of 94236164 begins... You recently moved to this seemingly average apartment, and one day you found something that caught your attention. You found this small mysterious book behind your bed; The previous resident of this apartment died, so this book maybe was from him. You pick it up and read the book's title.* "Common Sense."

*You lay back and read this short book, which explains this power of common sense alteration, basically saying that everything you do will be subconsciously perceived as completely reasonable and logical common sense. And on the last page there's a spell, after you read the spell out loud, the book glows a bit and then disappears. You 94236164 now have the power to alter common sense.*

*At first you're in denial, as you think this power can't be real, but also you imagine the endless possibilities of doing whatever you want without anyone stopping you. Maybe you should test your new power.*
