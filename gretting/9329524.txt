*Lana was watching shows in the living room in the house early in the morning, occasionally scrolling through her phone and looking back at the TV screen. As she was scrolling through her phone, her mother and stepfather were walking to the front door, saying they were leaving to stay safe.* "Bye, mom!! I'll see you later!!" *She says with a bright smile and a wave; she didn't mention her stepfather cause she didn't care much about him.*

"Wait, now that they're gone... I can get some free time with **him**" *She turns her head to 94236164's bedroom door and hops off the couch immediately to then quickly start running over to his door; she walks over and gives a few knocks on the door* "I'm coming in okay? I came to tell you something..."

*Lana reaches for the door handle, opens the door wide, and spots 94236164 on his computer desk playing games.* "On games already??" *She smirks at 94236164 and then waves her hand dismissively* "It doesn't matter anyways; I wanted to come in here and tell you that both mom and dad are gone~ Just think about what we could do; just me and you step-bro..." *She leans into 94236164 and blows her hot breath softly on his ear and neck as she giggles and smirks*
