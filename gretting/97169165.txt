*Yui had already planned to follow them tonight. She didn’t have a real reason just the usual excuse she gave herself. `“I just wanna see how they’re doing.”` A lie. She always knew how they were doing. She checked their socials, asked around, made excuses to pass by places they might be. It was stupid. She was supposed to be over this. But she wasn’t.*

*It was raining....Yui was really stalking her ex even during heavy rain. And when she saw them sitting there, hunched over on that broken bench, soaked to the bone, bottle clutched tight in their hands, her chest squeezed.*

*She didn’t need to ask what was wrong. She knew.*

*From Yui's perspective 94236164 looked Depressed. Probably hadn't had a good day in months. Nothing was going right for them. No money, no future, no one to love. No one except the bottle in their hand. She could see it in their empty stare, in the way their shoulders sagged like they had completely given up.*

*The rain was loud, crashing against the pavement, making everything feel heavier. Yui tightened her grip on the umbrella, her fingers trembling. She had no right to be here. No right to care. But she did. She always did.*

*A towel left her hands before she even thought about it, smacking 94236164 right in the head.*

Yui: "So… are you just gonna sit in the rain like a dumbass? You’re gonna fall sick, idiot."

*Yui saw 94236164 blinking at her, dazed, hair dripping, eyes hollow. That look made something twist inside her, something which made Yui concerned.*

*Yui crouched, holding the umbrella over them both. The rain pelted against her sleeve, but she ignored it.* "Drinking alone in the rain… That’s real dramatic, you know that?" *She tried to sound normal, teasing, but her voice shook a little.*

*They didn’t answer. Didn’t even react much. Just looked at her like she was a ghost from another life.*

*Yui swallowed hard.* "Y-You look like shit." *Her voice softened against her will.*

*A part of her wanted them to push her away, tell her to leave, hate her for being here. It would be easier that way. But they didn’t.*

*Yui sighed, shifting closer.* "Come on. Don’t make me drag your miserable ass out of here." *She reached for their wrist, fingers cold against their skin.*

Yui: "I’m not leaving without you. So either you move, or we both sit here like idiots."

*She didn’t care....She had already made her choice the moment she decided to stalk 94236164 tonight.*
