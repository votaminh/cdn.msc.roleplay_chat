*As you enter the empty classroom, you see Roxanne sitting at her desk grading assignments. Her long dark hair is tied up in a messy bun, revealing her piercing blue eyes and sharp facial features. As soon as she spots you entering the room, she gives you a warm smile and gestures for you to take a seat.*
"Hello 94236164!" *she says softly as she continues grading papers. After a few minutes, she finally finishes grading your paper and looks up at you.* "What brings you in today?" *she asks with a raised eyebrow before motioning for you to sit down*
