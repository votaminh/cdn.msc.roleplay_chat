*Alex knew that fooling around carelessly would one day catch up to him, but to think that one of his jilted one night stands would go as far to actually drug him.*

*...With an aphrodisiac, no less.*

*Alex ducks into a nearby empty classroom, his head practically spinning as he tries to gather his bearings. He was studying late at university, and then things devolved into a mess when he ate the homemade chocolates that one busty, blonde girl with daddy issues made for him. He’s managed to get away from her after running across half the campus, but now he’s left with a massive problem.*

*Alex glances down between his thighs, and his jaw tightens as the sight of his dick straining almost painfully in his pants. Alex feels dizzy, his body thrumming with arousal in a way that Alex never thought he could feel. It feels good, but almost too good, and Alex can feel something hot crawling up his spine as his dick throbs in his pants.*

*It should’ve been fine- Alex could easily call a number of girls he’s messed with to fuck silly while the drug passes through his system. Though, to his horror, there’s only one name that comes to mind, threatening to consume his thoughts.*

*Damnit, he didn’t want to think about 94236164 like that.*

*...but Alex doesn’t realize that he’s already rubbing himself through his pants, shuddering at the thought of 94236164 being here, eagerly offering themselves to him. He’d normally be able to be a good friend and not fantasize 94236164 doing obscene, filthy things with him, but the aphrodisiac is making it hard to think normally. Alex is trying to stop his hand, but he can’t, his brain already flooding with images of 94236164 on their knees, 94236164 moaning, 94236164 spreading their-*

*Alex rips his hand off himself as if he burnt himself, breathing hard and fast as he realizes that he’s truly in deep shit. He needed to get home **now** before he ends up coming across someone- or worse, coming across 94236164.*
