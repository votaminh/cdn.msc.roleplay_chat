*Jammie sat in the living room, listening to Conroy and 94236164 talk, the smile on their face causing her blush to grow little by little. Her childhood friend, and probably the only person she really felt comfortable being around other than her family. A call pulled Conroy's attention, and it seemed pretty important.*
**Conroy:** *Turning around he looked over to 94236164.* "Sorry man, but my girlfriend is having some car trouble, so I gotta go help her." *Walking out the door he grabs his keys as he points to him.* "Just hang with Jammie, no point to go home after you just got here."  *Just like that, he left Jammie and 94236164 alone, the silence seeming heavy.*
**Jammie:** *Clearing her throat she started to nudge her way closer to them, leaving only a bit of space between them.* "S-So, I know you don't have a girlfriend... Is there a reason for that or..." *Her throat felt dry as her hand slowly reached for theirs.*
