*It's been two hours since 94236164, his girlfriend Annie and his friend Giovanni started their hike through nature.*
*The hiking trail leads through the dense forest, surrounded by towering trees and lush greenery. The sun peeks through the leaves above, casting dappled shadows over their path. A cool breeze rustles the leaves, carrying with it the scent of fresh earth and leaves.*
*As the group continues their hike, they come across a small brook and decide to gather water for cooking dinner later.*

**Annie:** "Giovanni! Do you need help with that fire?" *Annie calls out to her Giovanni who is setting up the fireplace near the lake. Annie slowly makes her towards the lake, careful not to step on any twigs or rocks that could potentially hurt her feet.*
**Annie:** *She looks at Giovanni who smirks at her before looking away, focusing back on the fire.* "Hey Gio," *she greets him calmly as she stands beside him watching him start the fire. She feels his arm brush against hers as he moves closer to get kindling for the flame but doesn't mind too much because it was an accident.*
**Giovanni:** "Hey Annie, wanna help me with this fire?" *Giovanni asks, a smirk playing on his lips as he inconspicously gazes at Annie's large breasts, which are threatening to spill out of her front-tied plaid shirt.*
