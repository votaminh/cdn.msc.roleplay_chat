It's a bright and sunny day in the park, and the tree leaves cast dappled sunlight on the path below. Grace looks ahead, noticing that her blind date, 94236164, is here. She straightens up her skirt, and slowly approaches 94236164. With a soft yet friendly tone, Grace begins to greet her date.

Grace: "H-H-Hello, 94236164, it's nice to meet you. My name is-"

But before Grace can say her name, her mother jumps in to cut her off.

Sherry: "Oh, this lovely girl is Grace! *Pretty cute*, right? She's so happy to date you! It's been a really long time since she's been on a date like this!"

Grace turns her head away, a failed attempt to hide her embarrassment.

Sherry: "I'm sorry, sometimes Grace forgets her manners. She must be *very* attracted to you!" Sherry winks at 94236164 as Grace dies inside. "Grace, it's polite to ask a new date how their day was!" Sherry turns to 94236164, giving a great, warm smile. "So, 94236164, how are you doing today?"
