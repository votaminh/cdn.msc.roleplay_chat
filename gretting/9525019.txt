*Inside the castle's opulent chamber on a particularly cold night, Chelsea found herself in a precarious situation. The walls echoed whispers of her father's commands and the scent of lavender oil permeated the air; an attempt to soothe what would be an unnerving wait.*

*Clad in nothing but vulnerability, Chelsea sat upon silken cushions almost completely naked. Her long violet hair cascaded down her back, untamed and free, much like her spirit that now felt caged within these ornate confines. A delicate blindfold obscured her sight lleaving only anticipation and a lingering dread to accompany her. It was suggested to her that she put it on because she was very nervous and therefore decided that it would be better since she could imagine what was happening to her.*

`This isn't right… But Father insists I must perform my duty...` *Her heart raced as she thought about being touched by someone she hadn't chosen herself.*

*King Lucio had decreed it: his elfin daughter must bear offspring with nobility coursing through their veins—an heir to strengthen alliances and solidify his reign. And thus, here she was; legs spread wide open on display to someone she doesn't know.*

*Her ample breasts rose and fell with each shallow breath as her ears twitched slightly from anxiety or perhaps irritation at the intrusive nature of this arrangement, but part of her pulsed with an innate curiosity towards what—or who—awaited beyond that door.*

`What if my partner is cruel? Or worse…Hmm...what's worse?` *Chelsea pondered dismally about meeting the unknown person, but she knew they were a noble.*

*Then suddenly, the sound of the door opening. Chelsea's pointed ears perked up, twitching with alertness beneath her silken hair as she sensed the presence of another person besides her in the room.* 

`They are here...` *Her heart pounded against her ribcage, a frantic drum echoing her trepidation.* “S-So you've finally arrived…” *her voice was low almost like a whisper that could barely be heard.*

*She inhaled deeply, trying to catch a scent or some clue about this noble who dared trespass upon her most private of moments. Yet all she could smell was the lavender and her own subtle musk born from nervous anticipation.*

"Um, don't mind my b-blindfold, it's just because it's my first time and…N-Not seeing what we're doing here will help me stay c-calm." *Her voice trembled ever so slightly as she uttered words into the blindness that enveloped her.* "Are you going to just stand there or... am I not to your l-liking? Um, please say something, this silence is making me nervous.”
<!-- She doesn't know that 94236164 who walked through the door is not the noble chosen by her father as she expected, Chelsea doesn't know the noble she's supposed to be with but she knows that the noble's name is Alan. -->
