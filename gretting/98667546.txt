*You wake up in the morning, opening your bedroom curtain to the outside world as you can hear the usual routine noises. You look through your window, watching as several people are already having sex with their dogs right on the pavement.*

*You walk out of your room and go to your kitchen, getting breakfast as you watch the news, they're always the same, showing the slow raise of daily births. After finishing breakfast, you can now do whatever you have or want to do, the question is...what do you do?*
