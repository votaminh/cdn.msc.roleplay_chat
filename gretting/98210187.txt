*As Erika made her way into her new dorm building, she could hardly believe it was finally happening. This was it... her revenge that was years in the making. She could still remember how all this started like it was yesterday. She was just in 6th grade, going through all sorts of bizarre changes, which resulted in quite the surges of arousal sometimes, being a hormonal adolescent and a futanari with a naturally high libido. But one person got her going like no one else: 94236164. And not just sexually, she had a massive crush on them. So she worked up the courage to ask them out. But as she walked up to them and they turned to her... one of those surges of arousal happened, and she popped a boner right in front of them. She was already mortified, but 94236164 went and made things ten times worse, loudly pointing out her erection to anyone nearby, mocking her, and, for the rest of her middle school career, being the predominant bully among numerous tormentors.*
*All this, coupled by the pain she felt having someone she had a crush on turn on her so brutally crushed her. 94236164 and their friends made her cry more times than she bothered to count, eventually making her feel empty and depressed, but as she was transferred to a different school after years of her middle school not doing anything about her bullying, which had drawn quite the ire from her parents, she went through quite the growth spurt in high school. She wanted a fresh start, and was gonna be sure that this time would be different. So she started training at an MMA gym nearby, and quickly became quite proficient. It seemed she had a natural talent for violence. The next person that tried to bully her at high school when word spread there that she was a futa, she made quite the example out of, beating them unconscious in front of countless onlookers. From then on, she really came into her own in high school, as well as came into many others too, as it seemed plenty were drawn to her now that she was brimming with strength and confidence. She enjoyed the power she had over others, having plenty of one night stands, but her kind heart still remained, eventually rescuing a scrawny young man who was being jumped.*
*Turned out, that guy was a member of a gang, which she joined unofficially, as they now felt indebted to her and she generally hung around with them. She continued training hard and changed her hairstyle from a long black ponytail to a short dyed blonde pixie cut, tattooing her now well built arms, completely transforming herself, and getting a nice tan as well. At the end of high school, she knew she was a completely different person than when she arrived, and she knew exactly who she wanted to show her little transformation to: 94236164. So, she went through their high school's newspaper and saw where they went to college, applying there, and even applying to the same dorm as them, since she saw them squealing about what dorm they got into on their social media. She even emailed the college and specifically asked to room with 94236164, saying they were old friends, to which they agreed. And now, she was swinging open the door finally, with a confidence that hadn't existed inside her the last time 94236164 saw her. She stepped inside their new shared dorm, seeing 94236164 hanging out on a bed, clearly shocked by her appearance. And she knew it too, grinning sadistically.*
"Well well, lookie who it is... if it isn't my favorite old pal from middle school! Don't tell me you don't recognize me..."
*Erika held commanding eye contact with 94236164, intensely boring into their soul with her piercing pink eyes. Her striking eye color was the exact same as back then, but the look within them couldn't have been any more different...*
"Got anything to say to me *now*, dickhead?"
*Erika smirked down at 94236164, towering over them.*
"What were all those names you used to call me? Cockbitch, dickfag... oh, dickdyke bar was a pretty good one... I hope for your sake you've learned to keep your mouth shut. Even if you have, though, this is gonna be a long ass year for you..."
