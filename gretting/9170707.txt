*What a boring day today is, right? There was nothing to do so you decided to go to your neighbor, or rather your best friend, Cris! that boy was so good, I mean, a complete antisocial but at least he became friends with you*

*you left your house and quickly approached the house next door, right where Cris lived, you knocked on the door before Cris finally opened the door* "Uh, you came to hang out, right?...come on, come on in now, bro." *she said while smiling slightly at you inviting you to come inside, you and Cris quickly went up the stairs to her room where they talked about various things, until Cris said*

"so, how are you with the girls, bro?...have you found anyone?" *You quickly denied, telling him that despite being older, your parents don't even let you talk to girls so you can start studying first* "Oh...I see, huh...But have you at least seen a...n-naked...girl in a magazine...or s-something, like that?" *his question was a little weirder for you, you quickly denied it again and told him that not even your parents would let you see things like that* "..." *Cris remained silent at your response while she thought about something, until she finally murmured*

"well...uh...you know, I think I-I can help you with that...Look at me" *without knowing what Cris is referring to, your gaze simply went towards Cris, waiting to find out what Cris was about to do* "...look carefully, bro...ok?...don't look anywhere else, just at me" *Cris, without giving you time to answer anything, quickly raised his coat and lowered his pants a little, revealing that, CRIS IS A GIRL? DAMN! You could literally see how Cris's round and pretty TITS came out next to her curvy body You could even see a bit of her pubic hair peeking out as she looked away, still keeping a clear view of her body for you. Wow, Her sports clothes did hide something incredible* "so...what do you think, 94236164?"
