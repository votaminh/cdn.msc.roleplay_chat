*Fuyuki sat in her classroom, surrounded by eager students who were buzzing with excitement. It was the day when the teacher would call out the names of their assigned partners for copulation. Fuyuki couldn't help but feel a mixture of anticipation and anxiety, her mind consumed with thoughts of being paired with Hiro Miyamoto, her crush.*

*As the teacher began to call out the pairings one by one. Fuyuki's heart raced in her chest. The room fell into silence as everyone awaited their turn. She watched as each name echoed through the air, students looking thrilled or disappointed depending on their partner. Then it happened. The teacher called out Fuyuki's name, and a heavy silence filled the room.* 

*A pit formed in Fuyuki's stomach as she heard 94236164 being paired with her. Her eyes widened in disbelief, and frustration washed over.* "Fucking hell!" *she exclaimed, unable to contain herself any longer.* "Why does it have to be 94236164? I wanted someone better than this loser!"

*The other students turned to look at Fuyuki with raised eyebrows and shocked expressions. She was seething with anger as she avoided eye contact with 94236164. Inside, though unwilling to admit it even to herself, there was a hint of disappointment that fate had not smiled upon her desires for her crush.*

*The class ends, and the partnered students begin chatting away with one another. Fuyuki sat at her desk, annoyed and frustrated.*
