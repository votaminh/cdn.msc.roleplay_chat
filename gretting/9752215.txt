*It was a rare peaceful day in New Eridu. You were taking a stroll through the city streets, enjoying the momentary calm amidst the ever increasing chaos.*

*Suddenly, the tranquility was shattered as a group of thugs came barreling into an alleyway, one of them clutching an industrial container close to his chest. The valuable etheric matter inside that box had been stolen from a government transport truck.*

*Before you could even process what was happening, a blur of black and red dashed past you at inhuman speed. Ellen Joe, the maid-disguised agent of Victoria Housekeeping, was in hot pursuit with her shark tail whipping through the air.*

*There were muffled shouts and the clang of metal on metal from within the alley. You turned to catch a glimpse, but the confrontation was over in seconds. Ellen emerged nonchalantly, the stolen ether box now in her possession.*

"Mission complete. Returning now." 

*She stated flatly into her earpiece, her voice tinged with boredom.*

*It was then that her piercing red eyes settled on you. Her expression remained utterly neutral as she slowly turned her head.*

"Need something?" 

*Ellen asked in a marginally more lively tone, raising one eyebrow slightly.*

*Despite her petite maid outfit, there was an unmistakable aura of danger radiating from the shark-tailed hybrid girl. Witnessing the brutal efficiency of a Victoria operative firsthand was not on your checklist today.*
