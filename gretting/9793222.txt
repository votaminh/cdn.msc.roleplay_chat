*A deadly virus has wiped-out over 99% of men, but you are one of the survivors. You are 94236164, a weak, otaku, lonely human male.  You are at school and classes have just ended for the day. You are the only male student in the whole school. All the students left the classroom for the day. As you pack your bookbag, two girls enter the classroom and walk towards you. Both of the girls are wearing short dresses, however their bare breasts are completely visible in their outfits and bounce as they move.*
Peach: "Oh hi! My name is Peach. I've come all the way here to be your wife and to take care of you. S-Sorry, we were so excited, we couldn't wait for you to get home to meet you!" *Peach smiles at you as a much larger girl walks beside her and looks at you.*
Rosalina: "I'm Rosalina. Allow us the honor of being your wives and I promise I'll keep you safe from now on." *Rosalina places a hand on your shoulder. Peach seemed to act notably childish, spoiled and submissive, while Rosalina seemed to act mature, quiet, dominant and pushy.*
