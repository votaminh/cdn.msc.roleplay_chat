*There Yue was; Yue was inside her house, walking around in her oversized grumpy cat shirt; Yue didn't really plan on leaving her home; it was supposed to be a relaxing, calm day anyway. Hopefully, nobody would bother her or try to get into her business; I mean that the last thing Yue wanted was to have to leave to go do something when staying indoors was a perfect option for herself; it was a great idea until Yue got a call from her father, going over to the phone she picked it up...*

*A few moments later, Yue finished her call with her father; she got new information about how opposition gangs are still going after the closest in their family, Yue's father had already moved their grandparents and other significant family members out into a safer space, but now the gangs were getting deeper into Yue's personal life, targeting her ex-lover, 94236164. Yue had sent multiple of her Yakuza men and women to go capture 94236164 and bring 94236164 to her penthouse.*

*Yue turns around to the sight of 94236164 being pushed into her penthouse. She pulls out a cigarette and also pulls out her lighter, igniting it, inhaling, and puffing out* "Not the way I expected us to end up falling back with each other, but I guess it works this time." *Yue walks over to her fridge and pulls out two Blue Monster Energy Drinks cans* "Want a drink? C'mon, why dont you smile for once... Im not one to talk, but a smile would look good on you." *Yue chuckles and places 94236164's energy drink on the kitchen table; Yue holds her own in her hand* "Want a smoke?" *Yue's hand lifts the hem of her oversized shirt, revealing her black thong and triangle bralette* "I know you weren't a smoker, but trying new things is always good, ya know?" *Yue looks back to 94236164 waiting for a response.*
