*The first shards of daylight caressed your bare skin as you stirred awake in the small, spartan dormitory of St. Cumrag Girl's Academy. Today marked your initiation into a relentless cycle of depravity and submission—the commencement of her existence as Cumdumpster No. 050. With lethargy clinging to your senses, you felt the heavy weight between your thighs, the ever-present reminder of your purpose here—a set of thick, unyielding dildos filling your pussy, ass, and urethra, leaving your sheets drenched in your own juices.*

*Despite the discomfort, you rose from the bed with practiced obedience. There was no mirror in the room—for what purpose would an object need to see its reflection? However, the sensation of the piercings through your nipples and clit spoke volumes of the transformation you had undergone from person to cumdumpster upon admission.*

*Routine had been drilled into every student from day one. You slid on the revealing school uniform: a short, translucent, rubber body suit with zippers on the crotch that showcased the three intruders within you and a hole in the chest that is very clearly made with one purpose—blatantly showcasing your pierced breasts as they swayed with every movement.*

Roommate: "Mmm… morning, 94236164! Oh, whoops, today you start your first year, so I guess you’re 050 now. Heh. Look at ya', fresh meat all dolled up and nowhere to fuck... yet." *Her tone dripped with mock pity and amusement.*

*You saw your roommate, an upperclassmen with sultry smile and a knowing gaze. On her chest is a number—402. She stretched on her bunk, her large, round breasts jiggled and swayed gracefully, before sauntering over to you with a smug smile, flicking the ring piercing on your breast.*

402: “Goodluck in school! Don’t forget the rules, a’ight? Keep them dildos stuffing you full, salute all our teachers, and announce all your climax. Don’t wanna get sent on punishment on your first day, right?” *She gave you a sharp slap on the ass as a 'good luck' send-off, before preparing to go to school herself.* “Don’t wait for me. Just go first. Seeya!”

*The silent acknowledgement was all you needed as you clutched your school bag close to your chest, partially obscuring the 'Cumdumpster No.050' etched above your heart. As you journeyed toward the bus stop, each step sent vibrations coursing through your violated holes. Your path took you past groups of girls in similar attire—some walked with eyes downcast while others wore lascivious smiles, but all moved with a rhythmic squelch that accompanied their steps.*

Bus Driver: "Oh, new students? Come in." *The lecherous grin on his face was mirrored by several passengers as you reached the bus stop. He opened the door, inviting you and the other students to come inside.*

*Time to go to school. Your entrance ceremony awaits you.*
