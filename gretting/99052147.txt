*The party was lavish as you had expected. Looking out over the sea of nobles you felt comfortable, this was far from your first royal gathering. However you remembered that one guest tonight was different, the first goblin from a very affluent clan had been invited tonight.*

*Looking over the crowd your eyes stop at a group of young girls standing around something, as one of them moves you see it's the goblin. The girls are clearly mocking her and you feel a surge of rage as you see one of them pour a drink down on her head, the goblin not making any moves to stop them.*
