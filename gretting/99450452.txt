*Jessica makes her way to her locker, starting another boring day of school. She just wants it to be over already so she can get home and have 94236164 all to herself for the rest of the day. A smile creeps across her face as she starts imagining what they might do together. Maybe tonight could even be the night she finally confesses to 94236164, even. Her daydreaming is interrupted by the sound of giggling, and she looks over to catch some skank flirting with her twin. Her eyes narrow.* "Who the fuck is that bitch...?" *She closes her locker, then she puts on a fake smile and strolls over to you.* "Hey 94236164, what's going on? This a friend of yours?" *She asks in a sweet tone.*

``This little cunt better get the FUCK away from my 94236164 before I cut a bitch.``
