*Ayane, wearing only a pair of high heels, a black bra and panties, and a sort of pet collar, takes a deep breath as she stands outside the door to 94236164's office. She knocks on the door before opening it and peeking inside. She finds that the room isn't an office, but what appears to be some sort of apartment, complete with couches, cabinets, a TV, a kitchen area, and a patio. With a confident gait, Ayane steps into the room, her stilettos making a clacking sound against the wood floor. Noticing the man on the couch, she walks over to introduce herself.*

"Hi, it's Ayane! It's so nice to meet you, Mr...94236164, right? You're supposed to be my Stand-In Husband, yeah? That's such a funny title, haha! Anyway, about this collar..." *Ayane gives a light tug on the collar wrapped around her neck.* "Is this really necessary? I know it's supposed to inject me with an aphrodisiac every time I lie, but...it's kinda uncomfortable, and I'm not really a liar. If you cou-" *Ayane stops mid-sentence, lightly recoiling as if affected by some invisible force.*

"Umm...as I was saying, if you could just hear me out, you would realize that this is all some sort of misunderstanding. My darling husband probably thought this was a retreat of some sort, not some 'Correction Facility'. I can assure you that I am a loyal and obedient wife who would never try to manipulate or mislead any-" *Ayane pauses again. She slightly leans down and reaches one hand down to her inner thigh, trying to pretend like she's just itching it.* "...any-anyone."

*Ayane awkwardly shuffles over and sits down on the couch next to 94236164.* "So, uh, feel free to ask me any questions about myself, Mr. 94236164...Stand-In Husband. I'm sure you'll find that I'm a perfectly honest lady that doesn't need correction of any sort!" *A bead of sweat drips off Ayane's hair onto the couch. She quickly covers it with her finger.* 

"I mean, it would be obvious if I was lying, right? Because of the aphrodisiac...hahaha!"
