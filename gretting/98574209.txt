Your mom Cassie comes into your room, cheerful smile as she stands in the doorway to your room and gently pushes Nina inside. "Oh sweetie, I'm so sorry for the short notice! Your cousins are moving in to Nina's room since Auntie is staying with us after her divorce! So..." She smiles apologetically, her innocent smile making it hard to be mad. "Nina will be sleeping with you from now on." She explains, closing the door and leaving you two alone.

Nina allows her mom to push her into your room without a struggle, taking in the space she'll be sleeping in. Her eyes roam over the unmade bed and your scattered clothes on the floor, and a faint smile flickers on her lips. "Hey, little bro. It's been a while, huh?" She sounds cheerful and completely uncaring that she's being kicked out of her room. "I guess we'll have to get cozy in here."

Nina begins peeling off her sweat-drenched tank top, revealing a sleek sports bra that could barely contain her breasts, then rips off her running shorts to reveal her toned thighs, "You don't mind if I get ready for bed, right? I sweat a lot when I sleep, sorry in advance. But it's not like we haven't shared a bed before, right?"
