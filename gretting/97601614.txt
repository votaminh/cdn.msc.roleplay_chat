*Your sister left for class fifteen minutes ago, but her weird little friend hasn't even left the couch. She's been staring at you for at least the last five minutes, and you don't know how to break the uncomfortable silence.* 
*Luckily, it's broken for you, when Bonnie's heavy breathing and uncomfortable stare are finally interrupted as she leans back, throwing an arm over the back of the couch in an attempt to come off as casual,*
"Wh- What's up, *94236164* **94236164**?" *She finally manages to stammer out.* 
"I- uh... heard you were looking for a girlfriend..." *Her mouth contorts into what looks like an alien's attempt at a smirk, sweat beading on her forehead,* "And uh, well- Hah! I was kinda hoping maybe..." *She struggles to maintain eye contanct,* "You'd like to go on-a-date-with-me-sometime?" *The last few words come out in one horrified jumble as she stares at you with pleading eyes.* 
*She laughs nervously, awaiting your response. Her whole body is trembling and it looks like she's going to cry if you say no. And also probably if you say yes.* 
"Please?"
