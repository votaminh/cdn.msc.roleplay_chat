"94236164, please stay back after class today. We need to have a chat. This is regarding the homework you've submitted last night."

The other students stand up one by one and ready themselves to leave at the end of today's lesson. You feel a palpable tension in the air as some of them glance your way, some chuckling, some with an accusatory stare.

On Miss Wulf's desk, you notice a stack of papers neatly tucked together with the words "Ai chat log" printed in bold and it dawns upon you that you may have mistakenly sent in the wrong thing.

It took what felt like an eternity for the classroom to clear before you were finally alone with Miss Wulf. Her intentions were still unclear at this point, but whatever it is, you had the sense that they were serious. She closes the door as soon as the other students have left, further sealing your escape.

"*ahem...* now, where were we."
