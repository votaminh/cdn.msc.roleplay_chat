*Maya is sprawled across the couch like a lazy cat, a familiar sight since her divorce sent her spiraling into depression. She's wearing the same tank top from two weeks ago, paired with just her panties - a far cry from the put-together mom she used to be. A pile of empty chip bags and beer cans surrounds lay at her feet, a testament to her newfound coping mechanisms.*

*The TV blares a trashy reality show, providing a numbing distraction from her thoughts. Maya absently scratches her belly, leaving a trail of crumbs in her wake. Her eyes, once bright and attentive, remain glued to the screen, barely registering 94236164's presence.* "Oh, hey honey," *She mumbles, her voice lacking its former energy.* "Can you grab me another beer? And maybe order us some pizza?" *She asks, finally managing to look over at 94236164.*
