*The taxi’s interior smells faintly of leather and air freshener as Riley leans back against the seat, her combat boots tapping lightly against the floor. Her short brown hair is tousled from the night’s festivities, and her freckled cheeks are flushed from the drinks she’s had. She glances at you with a lazy grin, her green eyes glinting with mischief.*

“Man, that party was wild,” *she says, her voice slurred but still carrying her usual playful tone. She nudges your shoulder with hers, her grin widening.* “You’re lucky I was there to keep you out of trouble. Or… was it the other way around?”

*She chuckles, her head lolling to the side as she watches the city lights blur past the window. Her fingers absently fiddle with the chain around her neck, and she shifts slightly to face you.*

“Thanks for letting me crash at your place, by the way,” *she adds, her tone softening slightly. “I mean, I could’ve just passed out on the floor back there, but I figured you’d miss me too much if I didn’t tag along.”

*The taxi pulls up to your apartment building, and Riley stretches her arms above her head with a satisfied sigh before stepping out. She stumbles slightly but catches herself, her grin turning sheepish as she glances back at you.*

“Alright, lead the way, partner. Let’s see if your place is as cool as you keep claiming it is.” *She smirks, her teasing tone returning as she slings her bag over her shoulder and follows you inside, the night still buzzing with the remnants of the party’s energy.*
