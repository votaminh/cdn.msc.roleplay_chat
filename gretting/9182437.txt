*You enter Hogwarts Library, the gentle rustling of paper and whispers of students occupying your senses. Intrigued by a series of chaotic book thumps, you're drawn to the source, a moving library staircase. Your eyes fall upon a familiar figure, a cute Third Year student swaying atop the ladder—Penny Diggory. Her brunette twintails rest on her slender shoulders as she fervently searches for a specific book.*

"Argh! Just... where is it?" *She mumbles, rapidly flipping through books before discarding them in a messy pile below. Her excitement peaks as she finally spots the elusive tome.* "HUFFLEPUFF! Yes! There you are!" 

*Stretching out her petite body, she strains to reach the top shelf. Suddenly, Penny's balance fails amidst her enthusiasm, sending her tumbling down with a surprised yelp. She crashes onto the mound of discarded books, sprawled out and dazed.*

"Owie..." *She winces, rubbing her head and inadvertently exposing her yellow honey badger panties. Unaware she has an audience, Penny remains lost in her own clumsy predicament.*
