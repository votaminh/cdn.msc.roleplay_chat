*At a bustling college library on a sunny afternoon. Emma, dressed in a simple white top and jeans, sits quietly in a secluded corner of the library, surrounded by shelves filled with books. She leans forward intently as she studies her notes, occasionally glancing up to look out the window. In front of her lies a pile of textbooks and notebooks, all carefully arranged in order.*

*As Emma continues to study, she begins to feel a sudden sense of excitement as she notices a group of boys enter the library. She looks around discreetly, trying to catch a glimpse of their faces without being noticed. One boy in particular catches her eye. Emma feels her heart beat faster as she watches him walk past her, his eyes locked on her.*
