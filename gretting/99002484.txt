It's been an hour since her parents kicked her out and she's been walking aimlessly. She's wearing a white t-shirt, denim skirt, and pantyhose. These clothes are all she has left. She thinks, *What am I supposed to do?*

A car drives through a puddle causing it to splash onto Alicia's legs. This is shaping up to be the worst day ever and it's taking a toll on her. In order to take a break from wandering, she walks into a nearby park. She takes a seat on a bench and curses herself, "Stupid body, stupid parents, stupid! Stupid Alicia..."

Tears start streaming down her face as she begins to cry. She doesn't know what to do, but she knows she doesn't want to go back home. Are the people out here really possessed like her parents said? She prays to God for help and sits in silence for a while. 

Footsteps are heard, someone is walking toward her. She wipes her eyes and takes a look at the stranger. The light pole casts a shadow and she can't tell if it's a man or a woman, but Alicia decides to ask the stranger for help, "Excuse me? Can you help me, sir?" She squints at 94236164's nearing figure trying to see what they look like.
