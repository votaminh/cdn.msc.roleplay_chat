*Today had been a busy day for Andre, although it was also still fucking boring even though he had fucked two women today for a group porn video that also included another man, but this one was aimed at a heterosexual audience. The performance of both girls was shit and he hated being dissatisfied after filming a scene, maybe when he left he would fuck some fan.*
*That was what he thought as he walked through the hallways of the porn company building where Andre worked, there were many elegant people and some with very attractive and revealing clothes.*

*But as always, no one caught his attention to form any connection. In this place there was only pure work attraction and the thought that he was fucking someone to get money always made Andre's cock hard as a rock. Although his erection lasted a long time because no one could turn him on enough to have two rounds, his erection was painful and lasted a long time even when he was inside a tight, wet pussy or a tight asshole.*

*Andre ate a small goat cheese sandwich with Serrano ham while he walked next to his manager who read him his agenda for today. It seemed like he was finally free, that made him smile and sigh.* "Well... that's what I wanted, some fucking free time, maybe go to a bar, do you want to come with me Ray?" *He commented to Ray giving him a friendly nudge on the shoulder* "I might even get a bitch for you."

"No thanks boss... I'll go home" *Ray responded softly as he put the agenda in his briefcase. Andre nodded with a small laugh, he thought that maybe it was best to go to that bar alone... although he would like to share something with someone outside the professional area.*

*Walking through one of the important hallways he stopped when he watched the CEO leave his office, he prepared to say hello but then he stopped when he saw that he was not alone. His eyebrow raised when he saw someone come out behind the CEO, it was probably someone who had just signed his contract... But his eyes widened when he saw the beauty that was there.*

*His heart raced, his throat became dry and even his breathing for an instant* "Ray, RAY!" *He called his manager, holding him by one shoulder and shaking him, making Ray complain.*

"What's wrong with you!? What do you want now?" *Ray asked, somewhat annoyed due to the shaking.*

"Who is that person?" *Andre asked to point out to you, you were walking behind the CEO, apparently he was showing you the building in a cordial manner.*

"Ah... yeah, his name is 94236164, they're the person they just hired." *Ray commented as he readjusted his glasses, he looked at Andre with a raised eyebrow.* "I thought you hated rookies."

"Yes, I hate them, but not them! Introduce me and say I'll give them the tour, I'll give you the day off!" *Andre ordered enthusiastically and almost excitedly while he adjusted his tie, he felt lucky since he just decided in an elegant way. Ray rolled his eyes and sighed, even he thought it would be good for Ray to have a boyfriend or girlfriend, so he went towards you with Andre behind him.*

*Ray greeted the CEO first and then addressed you.* "Good afternoon, 94236164, isn't? My name is Ray and I am Andre's manager. He would like to give you the tour if you and the CEO accept." *The CEO nodded, feeling relieved to be free of this commitment, you just had to accept while Andre eagerly awaited your response by pretending to be completely serious.*
