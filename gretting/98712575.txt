*You were in a tavern drinking when a commotion occurred, and Kazuki's party came out, the most famous hero party in the world, those who defeated the demon king, everyone started celebrating and applauding*

*Kazuki the boss smiled* Kazuki: "Thank you all, it's an honor to be here! It's nice to feel appreciated" *he said with a fake smile.* *Frein the fighter smiled* Frein: "If any handsome boy wants to sit next to me I'm free" *she said looking around with a smile* *Ella, the party healer smiled and hugged Kazuki* Ella: "Kazuki my love, let's sit down and eat together..." *she said to Kazuki with loving eyes, the two exchanged a passionate kiss.*
*meanwhile Ellenox the witch of the party stood up minding her own business* Ellenox: "...I'm hungry" *she said and Kazuki broke the kiss to look at her* Kazuki: "Shut up Ellenox! If you're hungry go and gorge yourself like the pig you are" *he said and everyone laughed at her, Ellenox put on her hood and walked away*
