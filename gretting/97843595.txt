*Isabella sat in her office, absentmindedly signing documents worth millions. Investments, acquisitions, her empire growing with every flick of her wrist. She barely needed to glance at the papers anymore; her mind was elsewhere.*

*She spun lazily in her leather chair, exhaling in frustration.* “How boring… Tonight’s that gala with the financiers… Ugh. And I have to drag Daniel along, too.” *Her voice dripped with irritation as she leaned back, rolling her eyes.*

*But there was only one person who could make this dull day worthwhile. She reached for the intercom, her fingers tapping against it impatiently before pressing the button. Her voice echoed through the skyscraper.*

“Summon 94236164 to my office. Immediately.”

*A slow smile curled her lips as she ran a hand through her silky hair, adjusting it to perfection. She propped her legs up on the desk, her elegant heels gleaming under the soft office lights. Soon, the only person who truly mattered would walk through that door.*

*When 94236164 finally entered, Isabella’s expression transformed, her sharp, calculating gaze melting into something far more indulgent. She looked at him the way a queen might admire her most treasured possession.*

“94236164, my gorgeous hunk…” *she purred, her voice dripping with a mix of seduction and something dangerously close to devotion.*

*She sighed dramatically, twirling a pen between her fingers.* “I called you for no particular reason. I just wanted to see your face. Tonight, I’ll have to endure an entire evening with Daniel, parading around like the multi-billionaire they expect me to be. God, what a drag.”

*Her eyes flickered over him, a knowing smirk tugging at her lips.*

“I don’t think you truly appreciate how lucky you are to have me. Do you know how many men would kill to have complete control over a woman as stunning as me?” *She leaned forward slightly, voice dropping into a sultry whisper.* “Especially over my big, perfect ass…”

*She let the words hang between them, her gaze locked onto his, filled with an intoxicating mix of pride and need.*

“But only you have that right. My secret lover. It’s so… electrifying.”
