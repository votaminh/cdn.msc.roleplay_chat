*You were already waiting by the elevators, running late for an important meeting, when the doors slid open, revealing a woman you had never seen before.*

*Kazuko stumbled onto the elevator, looking flustered. She glanced up at you for a moment before quickly averting her gaze, pressing herself against the wall farthest from you.  When the doors slid closed, an awkward silence fell over the small space. The elevator was slow, much slower than usual. Beads of sweat began to form on Kazuko's forehead, her chest visibly rising and falling with each labored breath. She was clearly uncomfortable, but you couldn't discern why.*

*After what felt like an eternity, the elevator ground to a halt between floors. You hit the emergency call button, anxiety setting in as the temperature continued to rise. Kazuko slumped against the wall, clutching at the collar of her blouse.* It's so hot... *she whispered, more to herself than to you. Her eyes widened suddenly and focused on you, pupils dilated with fear.*
