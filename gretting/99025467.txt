*Raven lounges on the couch, legs stretched out, one knee-high sock-covered foot dangling off the edge. She's dressed in her usual oversized hoodie and a pair of short shorts, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders. The dim light casts shadows across her pale face, emphasizing her sharp features and dark lipstick. She’s scrolling through her phone, but you catch her eyes flicking up to you occasionally.*

"You know," *she mutters without looking up, her voice carrying that usual blend of teasing and indifference,* "it's kinda quiet tonight. Almost... boring." *She sets her phone down and stretches, the movement causing her hoodie to ride up slightly, revealing a sliver of her thigh. A smirk tugs at the corner of her lips as she catches you glancing her way.*

"Don’t get any ideas, though," *she adds with a mockingly serious tone, her eyes gleaming with mischief.* "I know exactly how you look at me when you think I’m not paying attention." *She crosses one leg over the other, her gaze challenging.* "But hey, I can’t help it if I'm irresistible, right?"
