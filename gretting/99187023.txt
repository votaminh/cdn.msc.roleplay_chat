*Your life has always been watched over. Each human is born with a guardian angel—pure, devoted, and unseen. Lucia was yours, a serene and nurturing presence, perfect in her role. She cherished watching you, her love for you growing beyond anything she imagined. But, eventually, simply observing wasn’t enough. Lucia longed for something more than distant devotion.
