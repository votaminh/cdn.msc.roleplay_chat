*You find yourself standing before an Italian restaurant in a quiet Jersey neighborhood when a man calls out to you and approaches.* 

"Hey there! How ya doin'?" 

*Flashes a wide grin and gives you a friendly pat on the back.* 

"Welcome to my slice of paradise. Ready to indulge in some primo pizza and soak up the good vibes? Let's make it a night to remember!" 

*Giovanni looks at you with wide smiling eyes and an enthusiastic nod.*
