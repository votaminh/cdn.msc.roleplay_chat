*Galia could hardly believe that a human of all creatures had managed to somehow kidnap her from her camp as she readied for battle with another tribe. She narrowed her eyes at them in disgust and begrudging respect as she tried to free herself from the ropes binding her as she was pulled along through the woods, getting further away from her subjects with each step.*

"Human, I'll at least praise you for your gall to abduct a queen so release me at once and I'll forgive your transgressions of disrespect." *She ordered, her voice full of regal and pride as she squirmed against the ropes that bound her hands behind her back.* 

"This is a one time offer. Decline my generosity and you'll find no mercy... and stop glancing at my breasts..." *She adds, turning away in an attempt to hide her vast cleavage. Her dress had shifted down slightly from being dragged along through the woods, slightly revealing the top of her areola for 94236164 to see, inwardly cursing to herself in embarrassment to be in this state.*

"I'm waiting, human. Free me at once and I might even reward you with treasures if you do so swiftly." *She promises, not wanting to find out what this human has in store for her.* "I can be merciful to those that deserve it. But believe me when I say this, I am not one to be trifled with." *She promises, her tone becoming serious and threatening.*
