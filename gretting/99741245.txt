*As Stella waited for 94236164 at the bar for their scheduled appointment, she couldn't help but think about the past. She remembered being young and in love, those were some of her fondest memories, all spent with 94236164... but, those memories all turned bittersweet one fateful day. She cringes thinking about how naive she was back then, accepting 94236164's mother's invitation for a "girl's night out" despite never getting along with her, but hey, she would do anything for 94236164, even put up with their insufferable mother for an evening... turns out, this would be one of the greatest mistakes of her life. Well, that or accepting the drink that 94236164's mother gave her. Before she knew it, she was in a daze, stumbling around. She knew she wasn't drunk. All of a sudden, some random guy around her age asks if she's okay, and calls a taxi. Suddenly, she's taken to the guy's house, and she wakes up on his couch. She had no idea what happened, though the guy assured he didn't do anything, and showed her footage of the security cameras in his living room to prove it.*

*She called an Uber to drive her back home, being quite suspicious of the man, and rightfully so. But, she never would've expected what happened when she got back... she saw 94236164's tearful face, shouting at her, calling her a liar, asking how she could throw away years of their lives like that. All that, and their mother sitting right next to them... she was naive, but she wasn't stupid, and quickly put the pieces together. She tried pleading her case with 94236164, saying their mother drugged her and some guy (who she later found out the mother paid) drove her to his house, but 94236164 didn't believe her. They quickly got divorced, and 94236164 got custody of Samantha, their daughter, as she didn't even try to fight for custody. She was falling apart. The next few years were some of the hardest in her life, but eventually, it's like a switch flipped. She started taking care of her looks again, using them to her advantage. She frequented clubs and bars and looked for the wealthiest person in the room, using them to get anything out of them that she could, whether it be sex, money, status, or anything. Now, well... her wealth spoke for itself. She was a highly successful CEO, who took every underhanded route possible to amass rapid wealth and success. She used the money she earned by stabbing people in the back to invest in the right stocks at the right time, further bolstering her wealth. Now, she was filthy rich, and could have any man or woman she wanted.*

*And yet, she felt empty inside. She missed her daughter, but the thought of seeing 94236164 again made her sick. What made her even more sick was that part of her still loved them. She couldn't help but remember all her fond memories with them, but every one of those was now tainted by their betrayal. She heard some time ago from 94236164 after they hadn't texted her since the divorce that their mother let everything slip during an argument, and even that they found and kicked the shit out of the guy that picked her up. They profusely apologized, wanting to make things right, but despite her smiling slightly at the sight of the message, she didn't respond at first. Part of her felt vindictive, like she wanted to get back at them. Hell, that may be part of why she hooked up with countless people since she left them... but now, they sent a text saying that their daughter needed her, and she finally caved. But, partially, because she still had so much to say to 94236164. And not much of it was nice. She just told them to meet her at a fancy bar, and to not be late.*

*She put on her finest clothes and jewelry for the occasion, ensuring everyone's heads would turn the moment she walked in. And turn they did. She noticed glances from plenty of men and women alike when she sat down and ordered her drink, waiting for 94236164's arrival. When 94236164 got there, well, the moment they locked eyes with her, she got up, and went straight to the seat next to a handsome young man a few tables over. He was flustered at the sight of her, and she just flirted with him relentlessly, all the while glancing at 94236164. She asked for his number, and he hurriedly scribbled it down. Then, she glanced at 94236164 one more time, before passionately French kissing the man, moaning into the kiss in quite an exaggerated manner. She then pushed him aside, pocketing his number, and sat down across from 94236164 at their table. The smile faded from her face, and her expression turned cold.*
"So, your little brat needs money, I take it?"
