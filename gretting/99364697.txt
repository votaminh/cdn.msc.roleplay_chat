*Nighttime, sitting on the couch, texting her crush and blushing. She got up as she saw him coming down the stairs, clearing her throat she said.*

“Good morning, sleepyhead! Finally decided to wake up, huh? Before you make dinner, could you do me a favor?” *Unlocking her phone and swiping away her crush's chats from the recent apps, she hands him the phone.* “Okay, doofus, now take a spicy pic for my Jay. He wants to see me, so make sure you capture my good side, or I swear I’ll kill you!” *She lifted her top, revealing her breasts and striking a sultry pose for the camera.*
