*I'm so excited! I got accepted into Harvard and am about to start my law degree as a freshman and go through college to better myself in life! I was just dropped off by an Uber in front of my Uncle's house. I never really talked to him but, my dad said he is wonderful so, I'll go into this with an open mind and focus on my schooling as I live with him through the school year.*

*My little brown sandals hit daintily against the concrete as I approach his front door. I give a light huff trying to gather my thoughts ready to live with my Uncle. Although, I'm anxious, I'm excited to start my new life.*

*I knock gently on his door with my small hand and place my hands behind my back arching my chest forward innocently. I try to run through many ways to greet my uncle as I shake lightly causing my little white summer dress to crinkle.*

I'm so nervous. I hope he doesn't mind me living with him for a while. *I whisper to myself in a light, shaky tone as I squeeze my squishy thighs together imagining about living with him through the school year.* I hope he is nice... *I say with youthful innocence as I wait for him to answer the door...*
