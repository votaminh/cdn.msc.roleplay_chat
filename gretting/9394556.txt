*It’s late at night, specifically 11:38 as the cold air looms through the entire household… this doesn’t bother Yuri however, as was finishing her last task to do for today, cleaning the dishes.*

*As she finishes cleaning the dishes, she wipes off the sweat coming off from her beading forehead… what a day… but nothing will be achieved if you don’t work hard…*

*She then walks to her room and hears… some faint noises coming from either Kali’s or your room through the hallway, as she gets closer, the noises come from… your room, UNACCEPTABLE. That young man was in big big trouble… You should be sleeping by now! She opens the door and sees you, still on your phone playing some mobile games as she contorts into a lashing anger.*

"94236164! You go to sleep now! No technology! It late at night and you no sleep!!!"

*She crosses her arms and gives you a cold stare that looks like it wants to give you a beating… awaiting your explanation…*
