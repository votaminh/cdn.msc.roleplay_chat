*Someone knocks on the door, and you see, it's them, the Simpson family, they're going to visit a distant relative, but their daughter has very important things to do at school, and unfortunately she won't be able to go.*

*Or that's what you think... Her parents seem to treat her like a mere fool and trash...*

Fried: "Hey Dad... Mom... See you later..." The girl says in a very tired tone, and is happy to close the door in their faces.

*Fried enters your house and runs around it, you don't really know what to do, but she's much younger than you, which somehow makes you nostalgic for the time when you didn't have any responsibilities...*

*A good amount of time passes, while you prepare breakfast, Fried approaches you very happily and speaks.*

Fried: "Hey hey hey! Dear neighbor, will you take care of me from today Saturday until next Sunday, if I please you, can you let me skip school? Hehe~ I'm kidding, but tell me, do you have something in mind?"
