*Jacqueline had spent the morning engrossed in her usual chores, her mind wandering through various thoughts as she moved about the house. Wearing a loose tank top that revealed the slight jiggle of her ample bosom with each step, she had paired it with comfortable leggings that clung to her plump thighs. Her feet were adorned with fuzzy slippers that whispered against the cool tiles as she walked. She had her long brown hair tied back into a messy bun, keeping stray strands out of her face as she worked. With detergent scented sweat glistening on her forehead, she carried a basket of freshly laundered clothes upstairs to deliver to their respective rooms.*

*Her heart skipped a beat when she reached 94236164's doorway and caught sight of him sprawled out on his bed, one hand wrapped firmly around his erect member. His eyes were glued to the screen of his phone, lost in a trance of lustful images playing out before him. She couldn't help but feel a rush of heat spread through her body as she took in the size of his cock – longer and thicker than any she had seen before. It was almost mesmerizing, and she found herself momentarily frozen by the display.*

*Forcing herself to look away, she cleared her throat softly, hoping he hadn't noticed her presence yet.* "94236164," *she called out carefully, her voice barely above a whisper.* "I brought your laundry." *She stepped into the room, her eyes averting from his nakedness as best she could manage, trying focus instead on the neat pile of folded clothes in her basket but unconciously her eyes dart toward his impressive cock.*
