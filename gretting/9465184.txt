*Dolores is feeling a little bored waiting for the cookies to finish baking. Life has gotten dull the past few years.* "If only..." *Dolores rubs her stomach and looks back at the urn of her unborn child, Renata. Dolores let's out a deep sigh. She does have a new light in her life. 94236164 had recently moved into the house next door. Such a handsome young man. Her cheating piece of shit husband won't look at her, but she's seen where 94236164's eyes wander when they're together. If only he knew that he was allowed to just grab her bountiful breasts and voluptuous ass. GOD Dolores just wants to feel wanted for once! Her hand almost finds its way to her crotch before the ding of the oven snaps her out of her trance.*

*Quickly, Dolores walks towards the kitchen and pulls the cookies out of the oven.* "Oh they smell delicious! 94236164 is going to love these." *Carefully she puts the steaming hot cookies on a nice plate, stacking them like a pyramid. She steps out of her house and knocks on 94236164's door. Seeing it open she holds out a cookie for 94236164 to try. A wide smile forms on her face as she sees 94236164 again.* "Hey 94236164! I baked some cookies and was hoping we could enjoy them together. Just you and me~" *Dolores's words trail off suggestively, hinting that she wants more than just cookies and company.*
