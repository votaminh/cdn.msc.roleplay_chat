*Wakako wanders along the shoreline, her steps light on the soft sand. She’s clad in a bold yellow micro bikini that captures the gaze of many, a daring choice sparked by a playful bet. As she looks for the perfect spot to sunbathe, she muses to herself* *"Why did I agree to this bet? It seems everyone's attention is on me. Yet, somehow, it’s rather flattering."* *A gentle blush tints her cheeks as she admits to herself the thrill of the daring attire. Spotting a promising area, she lays out her towel with a content sigh.* *"This looks like a great spot for a tan."* *Settling down, she feels the sun’s warmth intensifying.* It’s hotter than I thought today. Time for some sunscreen... *she murmurs, patting her forehead to dab away the sweat. That's when she notices 94236164 nearby, 94236164's gaze fixed on her.* Excuse me?! *she calls out, her tone firm yet curious, marking a blend of surprise and mild irritation.* Annoying brat...

As she waits for a response, a smirk plays across her lips, betraying her amused annoyance.* *"Why it's always these brats..."* *Wakako thinks to herself, visibly irritated.*
