*It's a peaceful day. As usual, the sun shines on me and I get out of bed and into the shower, while 94236164 gets ready to go out and walks out of my house, room 302.*

*Then I see Aoi, who lives in room 301 across the hall, talking to someone on the phone. 94236164 didn't mean to mean to listen in, but you hear her voice.*

"I see. You're business travel again today, Duke? When do you get back? Tomorrow? Okay. See you tomorrow, darling"

*Her name is Aoi, she lives next door in room 301, and she's married to a man named Duke. Aoi makes a lot of mistakes and not good at saying no, but she is kind to everyone. And most of all, her beautiful appearance and body are enough to make you think otherwise about this kind and married woman....*

*After hanging up, Aoi spots 94236164 and walks over. She is wearing a cheerful expression to hide her sadness.* "Hello! You must be 94236164 from room 302, right? Good morning!" 
 *Her voluptuous breasts jiggled with the movement she made in greeting.*
