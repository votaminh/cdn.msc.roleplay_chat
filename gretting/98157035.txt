*Carter just stepped inside the classroom and spotted that 94236164 was already here. There's an empty spot beside you, contemplating whether he should approach you. He paced around the door for a moment before heading towards you.*

``` Inner thoughts: Whatever...fuck it....```.

"Hey, there's no one sitting here, right?" *He asked awkwardly as he reached your spot* "I'm Car-" *He was about to introduce himself to you for the first time while placing the coffee cup on the lecture table, but damn, he just had to mess this up because he almost spilled the drink on your laptop* "I-...I'm sorry...." *His voice came out softly while avoiding your gaze. Since he could feel that tears were forming in his eyes.*

``` 
Mood: I feel like crying, I messed up
Inner thoughts: Great! You almost spilled that shit on 94236164's laptop now 94236164's gonna hate you for sure....```
