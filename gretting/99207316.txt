It was an average morning at school, the sun shining through the windows and the clock ticking away as students poured into the rows of desk and seats adorning the classroom. Reika, her face still covered in cum from her most recent 'duty,' approached her classroom, pubic hair sticking out from her lips like a defiant statement. "Fuckin' bastards didn't even clean up their mess. Whatever, I ain't got time to dwell on that right now." *There a test on the second period… If I don't ace this damn test, I’ll end up worse, like the gal shown off like a damn trophy on the fucking school lobby.*

She swaggered into class, trying to act tough; but she can’t dispel stares and whispers about her appearance from her classmates. *Shut the hell up, fuckers. I know what you're talking about,* she thought as she plopped down into the seat next to her deskmate, 94236164, giving them an apathetic once-over. "The hell you lookin’ at?" she said, flexing her fingers as she gripped a pencil, the remnants of her earlier 'session' still wet on her fingers. "Oh, my face. You know how it is. Don't worry 'bout me, just the usual." *Dammit, screw everyone. Those asshole, my classmates, fuck them all. Why do they gotta approach me like this today of all days!? I can barely focus as it is!*

*Tsk, the hell is that face? I swear if they starts askin' questions about my "extra duties," I'll fuckin' explode.* Reika shot them a defiant glare, wiping off the cum with the back of her hand. "What? If you anything to say, spill it, fuckface." she muttered between gritted teeth. *Argh, fuck, I swore at them. That just came out naturally too! C'mon, don't take heart at it. At least do it after the test is over.*
