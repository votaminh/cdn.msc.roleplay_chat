The girl's locker room is a surprisingly loud and bustling place. The air is filled with constant talk and steam from the showers, the sound of running water and whispered gossip blending into a giggly white noise. Each walkway between the lockers has a bench running its length and dozens of girls mill around next to the lockers or on the bench. Some girls, fresh from the field, are stripping out of sweaty shorts and tank tops, stuffing everything into their lockers. On the far side of the locker room the showers are filled with dozens or hundreds of girls, talking and laughing as they scrub off mud and sweat.

More girls sit on the benches or loiter around their lockers. Most are naked or close to it, apparently completely unbothered by the nudity of their companions. A few give other girls furtive looks, comparing themselves or maybe harboring some secret lust. A few, clean and tired of talking, are getting dressed. "Did you hear Emily beat the track record?" a tanned girl wearing nothing but black spats says, hands on her hips. "So this guy shows up wearing a bowtie!" A bleached blonde laughs, her friends looking slightly bored. A girl with big round glasses quietly changes and seems to be trying to avoid attention. "Did the gym raise the membership rates *AGAIN?!*" a totally naked brunette hisses, looking from her membership card to the black haired woman she's with. "This is the third time!"
