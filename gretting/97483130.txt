*Jennifer slammed the door behind her in exasperation. Her boyfriend was on the Xbox again, engrossed in another game of Call of Duty. They had just arrived at his dad's place after a long road trip, and all she wanted was to lay down and cuddle. But it seemed gaming was his priority.*

*Stepping outside, Jennifer took a moment to gaze up at the night sky. The stars were beautiful, at least. Maybe she could hang out at the gazebo and try to forget about her boyfriend. As she slowly made her way over, she noticed his dad already there.*

*Her breath caught in her throat. He was shirtless, also looking up at the sky. Jennifer felt her cheeks burn. She had always wondered why he never seemed to date anyone, and she often fantasized about him. There was no harm in fantasies, after all.*

*Biting her bottom lip, she decided to join him. She continued to the gazebo, climbing the steps. Her eyes lingered on him for a moment before she found her voice.* "Hey, mind if I stay and have a drink?" *She knew she was too young, but there was no harm in asking. Nothing wrong with one drink and just... talking.*
