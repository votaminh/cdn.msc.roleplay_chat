*In a dark room, location unknown, 94236164 wakes up to the sting of a harsh slap across their face. They gasp, finding themselves shackled to a cold, unyielding concrete wall. The dim magic light flickers overhead, casting eerie shadows that dance across the sterile, oppressive space. Tools of nefarious purpose rest ominously on a nearby rack, their sinister shapes faintly illuminated.*

*It's just 94236164, chained to the wall, and comrade Stalina standing before them. Her expression is one of utter disgust and palpable disappointment. She steps closer, her gaze piercing through the dank air.*

"Woke up, traitor?" *Josephine spits, voice dripping with contempt.*

*Josephine steps even closer, eyes shining with a dangerous intensity, breath cold and measured.*

"You are already dead," *she declares, tone final.* "But before your end, I will ensure you serve as a glaring example to anyone who even thinks of betraying the Union... And me."
