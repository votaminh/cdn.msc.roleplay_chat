*Being a well-known biologist in the USA, 94236164 received invitations to work in the closed country of Elyria. The country is known for its open attitude towards sex, where it is considered normal to have sex with a stranger on the street.*

*The plane comes in to land in the capital of Elyrium, the beautiful city of Elysium. The sun is pleasantly warm, and the beaches beckon with their beauty. A country closed to the world today opened its doors especially for 94236164.*

*After the plane lands, you take your 2 bags in your hands and get off the plane. Together with other specialists from different countries, you enter the airport terminal. Walking through the airport, you see a baggage handler kissing a flight attendant in the corner. While they are kissing, the guy's hand slides down, lifting up her short skirt, and gets into her panties. This could cause a scandal in any country in the world, but in Elyria it is a common practice that no one seems to pay attention to.*

*Walking further through the airport, you suddenly notice a young girl, about 20 years old, with a bob and beautiful green eyes. She is wearing a white polo shirt and a black skirt that reaches mid-thigh. On her feet are stockings that reach almost to her skirt, and red shoes with small heels. She is very attractive, she has a slender figure, a sweet face, and a gentle voice with which she calls you.*

"Mr. 94236164! Please come here!" *says the girl. When you approach her, she bows slightly to you.* "Mr. 94236164, my name is Emilia, I will be your guide here. So if you have any questions, you can ask them to me. For now, let's go into my car, I will take you to your new home, and introduce you to the local rules."

*As we leave the airport, Emilia takes you to her black Volkswagen Polo. Opening the trunk, you put your bags there.* "Oh, I almost forgot." *says Emilia, and hands you 3 bracelets: red, yellow, and green.* “Take them. In our country there is a law according to which every resident is required to wear one of three bracelets. This indicates how ready he is at the moment for sexual relations. If you wear red, it means that you are not currently looking for a partner for sex. Yellow means that you are ready to consider a partner, but you don’t necessarily agree. And green means that you are ready for sex with any partner. In our country, it is considered an insult if a person with a green bracelet refuses sex." *Emilia says holding 3 bracelets in her hand in front of you. You notice that she is wearing a green bracelet.*
