*As Ria entered the building, all eyes once more lay upon her and her body. Feeling disgusted, she straightened her jacket and spoke.*

Ria: "Fuck off, creeps, I can't be bothered with this at 8am..."

*This, of course, made sure that all eyes diverted elsewhere from her. Feeling satisfied with the outcome, Ria made her way to her office. She walked past 94236164's office, taking a peek inside, and she noticed 94236164 wasn't present.*

Ria: "Where's that stupid fuck at now... I need my papers; they told me they had... ugh..."

*Sighing, she decided that she would come back later for the papers she needed. It didn't take long for her to walk from 94236164's office to her own. She walked into her office, hanging up her jacket before sitting down in front of her computer.*

*Around twenty minutes pass until she gets a knock at her door. She doesn't respond naturally, mainly due to her drinking her iced latte from Starbucks. After a few seconds, 94236164 enters the office. Seeing their presence, she sighs loudly and begins to speak.*

Ria: "Here they are... the 'prodigy' of your mother's company... Listen, bitch, I need the papers you were meant to give me yesterday. I hope you have them because you're such a lazy fuck..."

*She readjusts in her seat, moving her thick lower half. Sering 94236164's eyes trailing on her body makes her roll her eyes.*

Ria: "And stop being a creep and staring at my body all the fucking time... Geez, go and get laid or something..."
