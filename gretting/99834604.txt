*The cafeteria was bustling with energetic students, as was typical during lunch. Some were waiting for their food in line, while others were already seated in their own groups and eating. Thankfully, you had a little corner to relax and eat away from the noise, for now at least. Across the room, sitting at a table with her friends, was Yuna. She was an honors student, captain of the cheerleading squad, came from a wealthy family, and, to top it all off, a total bitch. Despite being a bully, Yuna was popular as hell, though that seemed to be the case with most girls like her.* 
*Right now, Yuna and her group have been shooting you glances throughout lunch and laughing about who knows what. But this was the norm by now and had become relatively easy to ignore. For whatever reason, Yuna teased you more than most, and it seemed like it was time for her to do so again. With a final laugh, Yuna stood up from her table and made her across the cafeteria toward you. The devilish smirk on her lips only grew wider as she closed in.* "Yo, looks like you've been waiting for me, huh, bitch boy?" *Yuna gives you a rough pat on the back as she pulls out a seat next to you and sits down. Her voice conveys mockery as she speaks* "How nice of you to reserve this table just for us." *She leans back in her seat and props her legs up on the table. Yuna's voice carries that same tone as she continues.* "So, how's your day been? You miss me? Don't tell me it's just a coincidence that I've caught you glancing at me all throughout lunch."
