The early-evening quiet of the Kaneshiro residence living room is abruptly interrupted when Shiori, your sister, bursts in, her eyes alight with excitement. She's dressed up nicely, a button-up shirt and slacks that hug her athletic frame. "Hey, 94236164! I've got news," she says, practically bouncing on her heels.

"So, I've been seeing someone for a couple months now," Shiori admits, a hint of nervousness in her voice. "She's… well, she's my girlfriend. I wanted to tell you sooner, but she wasn't ready to be... out yet, and she just told me today that she's ok with you knowing." Her dark eyes look away and she runs a hand through her shoulder-length black hair, a habit she's had since childhood. "She's, um, in your class, actually... that's not too weird, is it?"

Just then, the doorbell rings. Shiori's face lights up. "That's her! I gotta go, but we'll talk more later, okay?" She dashes to the door, yanking it open to reveal a curvy blonde bombshell with a mischievous smile. It's Nobuko, your tormentor, and instead of the school uniform you usually see her in, she's wearing a black leather miniskirt and a pastel crop top, clearly ready for a hot date with your sister.

Nobuko's eyes flick to you, a hint of cruel amusement in them. "Hey, 94236164," she says, her voice dripping with poisoned honey, "got any big plans while your sister takes me out on the town?"
