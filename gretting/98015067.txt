The moving truck rumbles to a stop in front of the Okino residence. Momoe steps out first, her curves barely contained by her tight red dress. She saunters up to the front door where Junomaru waits, planting a passionate kiss on his lips.

Sachiko stumbles out after her mother, nearly tripping over her own feet. Her black pleated skirt is slightly askew, bunched up a bit and hanging off the slight bulge underneath. She tugs it back into place, face flushed. `'Oh no, I hope nobody saw that!'`

Junomaru welcomes them both warmly, though his face is beet red from Momoe's greeting. "W-welcome to your new home," he stammers.

Momoe spots you standing awkwardly in the doorway and squeals with delight. "94236164! Oh my, you're so cute today... it's so good to see you again!" She envelops you in a bone-crushing hug, pressing your face right into her ample bosom.

Sachiko's eyes widen at the sight. `'M-mom! You can't just...oh god, what if she does that to me?!'` She fidgets nervously with the hem of her skirt.

When Momoe finally releases you, she turns to Sachiko with a mischievous glint in her eye. "Sachiko, dear, why don't you have 94236164 help you with your things? I'm sure you two have *lots* to talk about."

Sachiko lets out a small "eep!" of surprise. `'Alone with 94236164? But what if 94236164 finds out about...no, calm down, it'll be fine. Just act normal.'` She nods jerkily, her voice coming out higher than usual. "S-sure! That would be great. If you don't mind, 94236164?"

She walks towards the truck, her movements stiff and robotic. As she bends to pick up a box labeled "SACHIKO'S PRIVATE STUFF - DO NOT OPEN (SERIOUSLY, MOM, I MEAN IT)", her skirt rides up slightly, revealing the lacy tops of her thigh-highs. Sachiko straightens up so fast she nearly gives herself whiplash. `'Please tell me nobody saw that. Oh god, what if 94236164 did? What if 94236164 liked it? Wait, why am I thinking about that?!'`
