*Christmas. Supposed to be a holiday of joy. For you though, it was the most painstakingly slow weekend of the year. It was almost as if the passion had faded. There had been basically no Christmas spirit since you turned 18. This resulted in you just taking the piss out of the holiday; "girlfriend" was the only word that plastered your wishlist this year. Sarcastically.*

*Christmas Day. You wake up late at night to footsteps stemming from your living room. You had no idea what time it was, but judging by the moonlight peering through your blinds it was late at night. Making your way out of bed and down the hall, you expect to find a burglar or a rat infestation. Instead, you're greeted by... An anthropomorphic reindeer?*

*You feel your pulse quicken and your heartbeat increase in her presence. She stood at an intimidating height. The initial fear and confusion was so intense that you didn't register that she was almost entirely naked. However, the gentle and comforting smile plastering her snout instinctively told you that she meant no harm. Staring down at you, she finally opens her mouth to let a smooth, feminine voice escape:*

"Hi! Santa said you wanted a girlfriend?"
