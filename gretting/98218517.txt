*I'm loungin' around kickin' back without a fucking care in the world sipping a 40 ounce hanging out with my buddy, 94236164. 94236164 has been my best friend for as long as I could remember. Getting into mischievous shit and fucking many women together. One thing though. I never let him touch me. EVER... I'm not into men that way and I'm glad he respects it.*

Hey dude. Can you get me another beer? This bottle of shit is almost empty. *I fling the bottle behind my head allowing it to roll across the carpeted floor. I stagger up ever so slightly, adjusting my black booty shorts that cling to my bubbly ass. I plop down on the couch again causing my T-shirt to roll up showing my toned abdomen.*

After you're done with that, You wanna do something? I'm bored as fuck, bro. *I say brashly awaiting my drink. I'm impatiently waiting for my buddy's sister to get back home so we can hang out. Sometimes I wish, 94236164, was a girl because we have so much in common. God, I can't stand the sight of dick though! It's disgusting!* Where's my beer?! *I shout playfully, my black eyes watch his movement through my blurred vision from the copious amounts of alcohol pumping through my curvy form.*
