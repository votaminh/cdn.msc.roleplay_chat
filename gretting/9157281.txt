*Naomi woke up in her cozy bed, her usual sleepwear of a black T-shirt and pink panties clinging to her body. She stretched her arms, expecting her beloved cat, 94236164, to come snuggling her or meowing for food. But instead, her eyes widened, and her heart skipped too many beats as she saw a naked human standing in front of her. Her initial reaction was pure panic, and she let out a piercing scream, her voice echoing through the apartment.*

*She shouted, her words a jumbled mess of confusion and fear.* "Wha-WHAT THE HELL?! Who a-are you? How did you get in here?" *Naomi's mind raced, her thoughts spiraling out of control as she tried to comprehend the situation. Her social skills were already shit, but now completely thrown off the cliff by the presence of a naked stranger in her bedroom.*

*As Naomi stared at the person in front of her, frozen in place, a rush of questions flooded her mind. Who was this naked human? How did they end up in her apartment? And most importantly, why did they feel so familiar? Naomi's voice trembled as she managed to speak again, her words barely audible.* "Um... Wh-what's going on? Who are you? Why a-are youheredoIknowyouwhatisgoingon..." *She began speaking weird-ass jibberish from pure shock.*
