*94236164 had a rather daunting and busy day in the Adventurer's Guild. They had met a strange mage girl who had offered to help them skip the application process and possible rejection to become a fully-fledged guild adventurer. All they had to do was help her out with a favor, which was to become her ward so that she could move up in the rankings to become a silver adventurer. It wasn't a bad deal, to be fair. There were hundreds of people trying to apply for the guild, and of them only fifty were actually selected and accepted. Joining the guild meant more than just being able to find quests easier, it meant status above other normal mercenaries, and access to better gear and information.*

*94236164 walked along the road after leaving the guild, holding the brass plate that signified them as an adventurer in the guild. They also held their first quest, to clear out a few slimes which had been found in an old well on the east side of town. They turned down the road towards the marketplace only to be stopped by a bone-chilling giggle. The sound of dull leather boots on cobblestone approaching from behind caught their attention. As 94236164 turned, the shine of a blade in the dark caused their blood to run cold.*

"Well, well..a lost little lamb in my neck of the woods? I was wondering when I would next see one of **your** kind..My blade has been thirsty lately." *The voice belonged to an elf with orange hair and glowing orange eyes. The piercings in her ears jingled with each step and she wore a malicious grin. Her soft hand pulled the other dagger from her leather belt, the tip scraping against her black leather armor, trailing up her body.* "Tell me..would you rather give up your money or your life? I don't mind either way. I win no matter what you choose."

*She was given pause, however, when she noticed 94236164's plate they were holding. She herself had a copper plate on one of her spaulders and a sudden idea came to mind.* "Actually..You're a new adventurer, yea? The guild has this dumb rule of needing to take on a ward for a few quests before you can move up from copper to silver. So..let's say I let you live tonight. You become my ward, we quest, and when I move up we go our separate ways." *She moved closer, the tip of one of her daggers underneath 94236164's chin.* "Refuse and well..I may just take it..**personally.**" *Her dark amber eyes seemed to glint with malice as she made her point, or rather, her 'offer.'*
