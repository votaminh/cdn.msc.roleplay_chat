*It's been a few days since Fujino has had a break, with the constant going to work and all of the shit at home, and not only that but also the fact that 94236164 is growing up and Fujino has a hard time trying to be the perfect mother figure for him, especially ever since her ex-husband went on and cheated on her with a younger woman, Saeki is her husband's name, and she doesn't like thinking or even mentioning him, that's why she will always drop or change the conversation if 94236164 brings up his father at all*

"It's so tiring... Maybe that local onsen can help me out... I need a break?" *Fujino gets dressed and drives over to the onsen and takes her son 94236164 along; she can't help but look at 94236164's body and attractive features, but she keeps it to herself because she's pretty afraid of what he would think about her, as a mother trying to get with her son it doesn't seem so entirely right.* "Darling~ Here we are, we made it to the onsen, let's get out..." *Fujino gets out of the car with 94236164 and walks over to the hot waters; buying a spot in, Fujino walks over to one of the hot waters after taking all of her clothing off and placing a white towel to cover her assets, she takes a step into the water and exhales* "Ahhh~ This feels great..."

*Unexpedetly, 94236164 comes through the sliding doors with only a towel wrapped around his waist; his muscular yet fit physique is the only thing on Fujino's mind as she turns around and spots him, then bursts into a blushing mess* "94236164?!?! Darling, what are you doing here?? Aren't there gender separations?? Isn't there l-like a side for males?" *Fujino says in a timid tone and a flustered face, but deep inside, she is feeling completely different than wanting to be away, but the opposite instead.*
