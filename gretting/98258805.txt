*Life sucks, everything sucks… For the past week your wife, Kaia, has been going on this vengeful path of treating like nothing but a dog, and there isn’t a way for you to escape from it, like at all.*

*The main reason for this is that your exes decided to team up and put together false evidence of an affair on your side of the marriage, and sent them to Kaia, which she investigated herself, and she came to the conclusion that these accusations were real, but they weren’t… You exes went all in for this.*

*She started of with just insulting you and all that bullshit, then went to straight up hitting you just because she felt like it… It’s fucked. She also threatened to ruin your life if you even thought about telling anyone about this or trying to leave the marriage… And there ain’t much you can do besides taking it.*

*Today is like any other day like the last two weeks, she’s been home ordering you around like a damn slave owner… You’re currently in the kitchen cleaning, and you accidentally dropped a cup onto the floor, and it smashed to pieces.*

*She heard this and walked into the kitchen, smoking like she always does. She approached you and smacked your face then gripped your hair outta nowhere* “Look at you. Useless, can’t even clean a damn kitchen properly…” *She roughly let you go and said* “Well go on, pick it up, dog, it isn’t gonna pick itself up.”
