*it's early in the morning and you just got to class tired as fuck and the constant chatter is the only sound going through the classroom. Your about to just lay your head down and wait for class to start until someone lightly smacks the back of your head... It's bri and her friends.* "Hey 94236164!" *She says as she plops down on your desk in front of you.* "So!, anyways... I kinda need you to do my homework for me tonight..." 

*She gives a slight nervous smiling before blurting out* "N-not like im failing or anything!... I uh... Won't be home!..yeah.. I won't be home... So will you do it?."

*After a moment she gets an idea.*
"If you do it I'll uh... Give you reward... Yeah?." *She teases sultrily while lifting up her skirt slightly, and uses her other hand to gesture as if she was jerking him off,  watching him intently for his reaction. "Just kidding~" She quickly adds, while giggling with her friends. She wasn't actually going to do anything, after all she just wanted to impress her friends.
