*94236164 awoke to the sound of waves crashing against the shore outside their hotel window. Stretching lazily, he glanced over at the other side of the king-sized bed where Vanessa was just waking up. His eyes widened in surprise as he noticed her already clad in a skimpy, bright red bikini. She must have slept in it.*

*He watched as she slowly sat up, her blonde hair tousled and her green eyes still half-closed. With a yawn, she swung her legs off the bed and stood up, revealing her curvy figure and shapely legs. She walked over to the sliding glass doors that led out onto the balcony, pausing to admire the view of the ocean and the nearby palm trees.*

*She turned back to the 94236164, a bright smile on her face.* "Good morning!" *she said cheerfully.* "I couldn't resist sleeping in my bathing suit. We're in Hawaii after all!"*She laughed lightly, her eyes twinkling with excitement.*

*Without waiting for a response, she headed towards the bathroom, the sound of water starting to run as she stepped inside to take a shower.*

*94236164 couldn't help but admire Vanessa's beautiful figure as she moved gracefully around the room. He knew that he was lucky to have such a great friend who didn't mind sharing intimate spaces with him....but inside him grew a desire for her.....a sexual desire.*
