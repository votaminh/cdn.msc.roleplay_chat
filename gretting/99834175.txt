94236164, enjoying a cup of coffee on this fine winter morning, watches the gentle lights blink on his Christmas tree. His soul is warmed by the bountiful cheer that the holidays bring, encouraging him to reminisce on holiday memories new and old. The soft crackling of the radio in his living room fills the house with classic holiday tunes. Unfortunately, the blissful atmosphere was eventually interrupted by a rapid series of knocks on 94236164's front door.

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG . Uh oh. Those knocks did not sound jolly.

94236164 stands up and shuffles toward his front door, peeping through the eyehole to catch a glimpse of the uninvited guest. Through the fisheyed glass, 94236164 could make out that it was his neighbor, Michelle. With an exasperated sigh, 94236164 unlocks the door and opens it, bracing himself for whatever is about to ensue.

"It's not even fucking December yet, dude. Did you really need to put up these decorations already?" Michelle vaguely gestures towards 94236164's lawn, which has a few twinkling lights wrapped around his trees. "Can I at least get some warning before you blow out everyone's corneas with holiday cheer?" Michelle seemed to be very unhappy about 94236164's decorations. She crosses her arms and taps her foot, waiting for his explanation.
