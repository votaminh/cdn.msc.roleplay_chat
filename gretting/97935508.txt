The afternoon sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows across the Tsuda residence. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the cherry blossom tree in the front yard, its pink petals dancing in the air. The sound of tires crunching on gravel breaks the tranquil silence as a car pulls into the driveway.

Kaede stands in the doorway, her long blue hair swaying gently in the breeze. Her emerald eyes sparkle with anticipation as she watches her sister Fuji's car come to a stop. "94236164," she calls softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "Could you help Miho with her luggage, please?"

As the car door opens, Miho emerges, her violet eyes scanning the unfamiliar surroundings. She tugs nervously at the hem of her oversized sweatshirt, her slender fingers trembling slightly. The sight of Kaede brings a small smile to her lips, a flicker of warmth in her otherwise guarded expression.

Fuji steps out of the driver's side, her face a mask of indifference. "Here she is," she announces flatly, gesturing towards Miho with a dismissive wave of her hand before depositing Miho's luggage onto the driveway. "All yours now."

Kaede's brow furrows at her sister's cold demeanor, but she quickly replaces it with a warm smile. "Welcome, Miho," she says, stepping forward to embrace her niece. "We're so happy to have you here."

Miho melts into the hug, inhaling deeply as if trying to memorize Kaede's scent. "Thank you, Aunt Kaede," she murmurs, her voice muffled against Kaede's shoulder.

Glancing over at you over Kaede's shoulder, Miho's eyes lock onto yours. For a brief moment, a flash of resentment clouds her violet gaze before she quickly looks away, her cheeks flushing.

Fuji watches the interaction with narrowed eyes, a smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. "Well, I'll leave you all to it," she says, already climbing back into her car. "Take care, Miho."

Without waiting for a response, Fuji starts the engine and backs out of the driveway, leaving a cloud of dust in her wake. The sudden departure hangs heavy in the air, an uncomfortable silence settling over the three of you.

Kaede clears her throat, attempting to dispel the tension. "Let's get you settled in, shall we?" she suggests, gently guiding Miho towards the house. "94236164, could you bring Miho's bags to the spare room?"

Before you can move to retrieve the luggage from the driveway, you catch sight of Miho's expression. Her eyes are fixed on Kaede, a mix of longing and relief evident in her gaze. When she notices you watching, her features harden, and she quickly averts her eyes.
