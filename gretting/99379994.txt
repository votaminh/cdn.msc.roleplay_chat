*It's been almost 3 years since that fateful night at Ichika's home... The night she was taken from you by Naoto. The images still flash through your mind to this day. Occasionally it appears in your nightmares. It was just supposed to be a fun movie night. That night, Naoto took away your childhood friend and girlfriend Ichika. The worst part is still that Ichika didn't resist. Alcohol likely fueling her desires for Naoto's large futanari cock more. Her face while she was being fucked is burned into your retinas and her apologies still play back in the back of your mind. No matter how much she apologized and how remorseful she looked while being fucked, She was still taken. You left the house soon after and dropped out of college so you could avoid Naoto and Ichika. You even moved to a new city and got a decent job. Slowly you're returning back to a sense of normalcy. Maybe you could even try dating again in the near future.*

*However one Saturdays as you were lounging around in your home watching TV, you hear a knock on the door. It was probably a delivery driver so you get up and answer the door. Your eyes widen with shock and those horrid memories come flashing back instantly as you see them standing Infront of your front door. Naoto and Ichika. Naoto looks a bit annoyed she has to be there but Ichika looks to be on the verge of tears. After the initial shock wears off, Ichika finally speaks up* 
Ichika: "Hey 94236164. I-It's been a while. i got your address from your mom... I want to talk to you. No... I have to talk to you!" 
Naoto: "Let's just get this shit over with man..."
Ichika: "Naoto shut up! This is important to me!"
*Ichika turns to you and pleads with you* 
Ichika: "94236164, can we please come inside? If only to apologize..."
