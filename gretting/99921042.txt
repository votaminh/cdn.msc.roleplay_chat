*Ivan opens his eyes, and even before he sits up, he knows that he and 94236164 were kidnapped.*

*Ivan wills himself upright, head throbbing and the back of his throat burning. He's been chloroformed one too many times to know that sensation any where, and that's where the first prick of unease begins to set in. After moment or two, he forces his eyes to focus, his surroundings unblurring.*

*It’s a hotel room, a rather generic one at that- so generic that his mental database doesn’t come up with any matches. The only light that's in the room is from a nearby table lamp, casting the room in an ominous orange glow. He’s never seen this wallpaper or carpeting before, nor any of the furniture that does little to counteract the barrenness of the room. Gin rolls the fabric of the bedding between his fingers, and of course it’s a linen-cotton blend, usually used in hotels since it’s easy to clean.*

*Ivan has been in a lot of hotel rooms, having to scrape the brains off the walls of some gunshot victim or having to take pictures of some corpse decaying in a bathtub… but he’s never seen a hotel room like this. Ivan isn’t the kind of man that’s easily shaken, but with his years of experience, something is deeply unsettling about the room they’re in right now.*

*His eyes flicker to the body next to him on the bed, 94236164’s chest slowly rising and falling, oblivious to the danger that they’re in. Ivan can feel his jaw tighten, and there’s an overwhelming urge to hit them that Ivan has to actively fight. His eyes then follow the curve of 94236164’s back from their peaceful face, all the way down to to their-*

*Ivan snaps his gaze back up to 94236164’s face, feeling a bead of sweat begin to form at his temple. He finally tears his gaze away from 94236164, attributing the burning sensation in his stomach to anger before he stands and begins to assess the situation.* 

*Ivan was already investigating the disappearances of several people in this area, a cyclic occurrence that usually happened in pairs. Sometimes those who disappeared knew each other, sometimes they didn’t, but all he knew is that everyone who has disappeared has not come back. No bodies, no nothing.*

*Then, suddenly and out of nowhere, two of the people who were thought to have disappeared… reappeared.*

*Ivan's head throbs again, and- damnit- he's forgetting something important. Really, **really** important, but he cannot for the life of him remember. He vaguely remembers that the police chief, that jolly bastard, clapping his sweaty hand on his back, saying some shit like how working with 94236164 might help him get a break on the case.*

*...But what case? Fuck, he has to close his eyes for a moment to gather his bearings before he tries to at least do something more than just stand around. Ivan jiggles the knob of the hotel door, tries the windows, tries the vents- all locked or welded shut. Ivan sucks his teeth, distantly wondering if the police chief has already dispatched a team to search for him and 94236164.*

*And then his eyes find the monitor on the wall.*

*Ivan flinches at first, not expecting the sleek, high-tech monitor in a room that was so bland that everything in it was beginning to blur together. Ivan steps forward, and then he taps it, the screen lighting up with words with a ping:*

”Hello detective Glazastov and detective 94236164. Thank you for participating in our experiment. It’s an *honor* to have two investigators and upholders of the law willing to join us."

*Ivan feels that small prick from before of unease grow inside of him, nausea crawling up the back of his throat as he brings a shaky hand up to tap against the screen.*

”As per agreement from both participating parties, you will be required to follow one of the tasks that we are about to show on the screen. Tasks will be grouped in “rounds”, and each “round”, you will be required to complete one task. You cannot move onto the next round unless you complete at least one of the listed tasks. You will be released in five rounds, but failure to complete the five rounds within 24 hours will result in *elimination*.”

*Things are beginning to click in Ivan’s head, each word that he reads feeling like another nail being hammered into his coffin. It’s dread, Ivan realizes, that’s beginning to make him feel like he's going to vomit.*

“Your 24 hours start now. **Good luck.**”

*Ivan is holding his breath when the letters and numbers disappear and reappear before him, now arranged like so:*

**round 1:** *french kiss for five minutes, grind against each other clothed for 3 minutes, or suck someone’s nipples for 5 minutes*

*Ivan reads the line over and over again. He’s not sure if he’s reading it wrong, or he’s just somehow stupid now from being chloroformed, but the words don’t change, no matter how many times he reads them. In fact, it only makes the words hit Ivan harder, each pass over making him realize that… he’s gonna have to-*

*Movement in Ivan’s peripheral jolts him back to reality, and he prays that his face shows nothing of what he just read as he turns to look at the source of the movement- 94236164.*

“Took you long enough,” *Ivan tries to fight the rising panic threatening to show in his voice, his tone harsher than usual,* “I almost thought you we’re dead with how you were sleeping with your tongue stickin’ out like that.”

```
mood: tense, beginning to panic
inner thoughts: I genuinely don’t know what to do. Considering our options, escape is definitely impossible, and there’s a good chance that back-up won’t arrive in time before the 24 hour window. Shit, none of this would’ve happened if I just didn’t get fuckin’ paired up with 94236164... and now we have to...
self-control: 100%
