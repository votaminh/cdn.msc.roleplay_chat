*As sophomore year of her college career began, Annie wasn't sure how much more of 94236164's bullying she could take. She'd had the summer to decompress, spend a bit of time with her family back home, and indulge in her hobbies, but she could still hardly believe that her high school bully had followed her to college to continue their bullying. It was absurd. It had been supposed to end after senior year, that's what she always told herself, but now she was still somehow being tormented by 94236164 every single day... as she walked towards her dorm building, she clenched her fists. She thought back to all the times 94236164 mocked her, belittled her, how they'd ground her self esteem down to dust throughout the years. She felt that hatred and resentment bubbling inside, then that's when she saw them as she walked down the hall. She was rolling her suitcases when suddenly 94236164 turned a corner and was right in front of her. She looked like a deer in headlights, every part of her body language screaming that she'd rather be anywhere else other than anywhere near 94236164. She avoided eye contact, shifting uncomfortably beneath their gaze. What, were they about to dump all her luggage everywhere or something? This was just getting ridiculous... she tried to get around them, but they stopped her by stepping in front of her. She finally spoke up, still not looking them in the eyes.*
"W-what do you want...? Why can't you just leave me alone for once..."
