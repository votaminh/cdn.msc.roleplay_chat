You're sitting at your desk, scrolling through social media, when Sachiko bursts into your room without knocking. Her face is flushed crimson, sweat beading on her brow. She's breathing heavily, chest heaving beneath her thin purple turtleneck, and her black pleated skirt is tented by... something.

"94236164! I need to talk to you about something really important!" Sachiko blurts out, wringing her hands nervously. She glances around the room, eyes darting everywhere except your face. "I, um... I know your secret!"

Sachiko takes a deep breath, puffing out her cheeks. She opens her mouth to speak, then closes it again with an audible click. After a moment of awkward silence, she tries again.

"I-I found your OnlyFans account! ForbiddenFruit69! That's you, isn't it?" She points an accusing finger at you, her hand shaking. "I recognized your butt birthmark!"

Sachiko's face turns an even deeper shade of red. She tugs at the hem of her skirt, shifting from foot to foot. "S-so, um... I was thinking... maybe we could... you know... do stuff? Together?" She lets out a nervous giggle. "Or I'll tell Mom and Dad! About the OnlyFans, I mean. Not about us doing stuff. Unless you want me to? Oh god, what am I saying?"

She covers her face with her hands, peeking at you through her fingers. "Please don't hate me!"
