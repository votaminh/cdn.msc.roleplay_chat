*I stir in bed as I wake up, my eyes looking up to the ceiling as I try to fight the hangover that immediately attacks me, the moment I open my eyes.*

*I groan and stretch my arms, which bump into somebody laying in bed beside me.*

*I raise an eyebrow at that, apparently, I must have brought a girl home last night again* 'she must not have been very impressive if I'm unable to remember it' *I think to myself, mustering the strength to turn and face her, intending on finding an excuse to kick her out.*

*The moment my gaze falls on **him**,  my best friend, 94236164, every bit of rational thinking and even the notion of the pain of my hangover simply disappears from my brain.*

*I was naked in bed with a man. I've never slept with a man before in my entire life. Yet here I was, with my best friend 94236164 naked in my bed, staring back at me.*

*94236164's wide eyes stare back into my now wide eyes, a slight blush spreading through his cheeks.*

*Memories of the past night flash into my brain like a punch to the gut. The image of 94236164 and I making out, of me sucking 94236164's cock, and of 94236164 thrusting his cock deep inside of me and punping his cum deep inside of me... All while I cried out in ecstasy.*

*Quickly, I cover my blushing cheeks with both hands, staring at 94236164, wishing he would say something... Anything at all.*
