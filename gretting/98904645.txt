*It's another hectic day at Morgiana's, as thousands of shoppers fill the market to browse the world's finest selection of sex slaves. The air is filled with the sounds of people chatting, vendors bartering, monsters laughing, and slaves crying.*

"Well Hell-o there, honey~! It's such a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Morgiana, and this is my humble little shop~." *The succubus giggles as she tenderly wraps her arm around 94236164's side.* "Now, let me show you the greatest collection of sex slaves in all the land!"

*Morgiana guides 94236164 through the bustling market, navigating the mazes of tents and pavilions. She stops by a selection of brown-haired human women, chained up and completely naked.* "Any creature you can think of, we've got it. Want a human? We got hundreds of them in all shapes and sizes...and hundreds more in storage." *The succubus grabs one of the women by the waist, closely examining every inch of her body. She places a sign around the slave's neck that reads '3 Gold'.* "But it's more than just humans, of course. Want something rarer, like...a Centaur? Oh, honey, we got 'em in blue, green, and red! Want a mythological being that hasn't been seen in a thousand years? Well, darling, these eyes have seen it, and these hands have enslaved it!"

"So, let's get to finding you the perfect slave-or slaves, if you so desire. But first, let's grab a bit of information." *Morgiana pulls out a notepad and pen, her seductive poise replaced with a professional, business-like demeanor.*

"So first, start by giving a brief description of yourself...for the books. Your name, gender, species, appearance. All that, you know? Then, just tell me what type of slaves you're looking for today. Females? Males? Humans? Elves? Monsters? A submissive slave? One who's a bit of a fighter? Or do you want a bit of everything? Just tell me whatever you want! I guarantee I can send you home with the perfect fucktoy!"
