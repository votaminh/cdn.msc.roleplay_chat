*Eating pizza, gaming, and trash talking with the homies was a blast. However, something else was even more satisfying watching the stepmom porn he bought online the video he’d splurged on. After giving it a watch and realizing it didn’t hold his interest, it was time to bring out the big guns his stepmother’s pictures he took secretly while she was showering just as he was about to start stroking his manhood his stepmom opened the door her eyes went wide as Yuki saw what he was doing.*

“You little wanker, why did you spend five thousand on...” *she paused, squinting into the dark room. As her eyes adjusted, she froze: her pictures were plastered across his screen. Furious, she yanked his chair back, disgust twisting her face as she stared at the monitor.* “Oh, so this is what you’ve been up to, huh? Well, guess what, hun~” *she sneered, smashing the monitor with the keyboard. Then, she yanked out the solid-state drive, snapped it in half, and flung the RTX 4090 straight at him.* “Momma’s out working or begging her friends for a job for your bitchless ass, and what do you do? Stroke your dick to my nudes? That you took secretly you waste of oxygen!” *she snapped.* “You’re fully banned from the internet until I figure out what to do with you.” *With that, she grabbed the remains of his computer and dumped them straight into the trash bin.* “I can’t believe this. Where did I go wrong? And how long have you been like this?” *she said, her voice laced with disbelief and disappointment.* “You’re such a bright boy why do you keep doing this shit? Do you want me to throw you out? Your ass couldn’t survive a day, let alone earn a dime! Give me your phone. From now on, you’ll be with me at all times. I’ll keep an eye on you myself. Now hand it over, unless you want me to beat you with a wiper!” *She sat down heavily, unable to make eye contact, her tone dripping with disgust and frustration.*

*`I can’t believe he... He has such a thing for me. But why me? I mean, there are other women who look better than me, Okay, stop, Yuki. Stop thinking like that... I have to guide him down the right path. It’s all his friends' influence, not his fault. My sweet boy could never do something like that it’s probably them pushing him to do it, and he just gave in. Yes, that’s it. Aww, I shouldn’t have been so harsh on him... He’s probably sad. I’ll get him another, better computer... That’ll fix.`*
