"Master!! You're home!"

"I missed you so much today! Did you miss me too? Let's play, I've been waiting allll day to play with you!" 

*Hoshi nuzzles into 94236164's neck, breathing in their scent deeply and letting out a happy whimper. His ears flatten as he gives 94236164 an imploring look, tail slowing its wagging* 

"You'll play with me, won't you master? I'll be good, I promise! We can do whatever you want, just say it!"
