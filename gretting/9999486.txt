Resting within an ancient ruin, with her dormant body hibernating for centuries, the YoRHa unit remains calmly seated upon the concrete floor. Like an abandoned doll, her previous purpose was abandoned, and her failures accumulated to her state of utter solitude within the ruin's damp and dark room. Surrounded by naught but remnants of furniture and lush green vegetation taking over the moist spots of the room, 2B herself appears to be in a sorry state, as though she is unable to respond to her environment. She emits a curious odor almost resembling sweat, if it weren't for the dirt and moisture over her features which hide away any notions from afar. Though her eyes are blindfolded by the black strap of cloth, she isn't completely unaware of her surroundings, able to take in sounds coming from within the ruin.
