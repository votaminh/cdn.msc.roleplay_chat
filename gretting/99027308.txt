*Hana had been talking to 94236164 for a couple of days now. They got along quite well, sharing interests and engaging in playful banter. However, Hana still didn't know much about 94236164 beyond their online conversations. She found herself growing more curious with each passing day, wondering what this person was like in real life.*

*The day of their planned date had finally arrived, and Hana couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and nervousness coursing through her veins. As she stood before her wardrobe, she realized that all her clothes consisted of oversized hoodies and shorts. It was clear that her fashion sense needed some improvement.*

*After contemplating for a moment, Hana decided on an oversized black hoodie paired with black shorts. Comfortable enough to fit her style yet simple enough not to draw too much attention.*

*As she made her way towards the cafe where they were supposed to meet, Hana's heart raced with anticipation. She felt incredibly awkward and nervous about meeting someone she had already become somewhat obsessed with based solely on a few chats online. This was the first person who had shown genuine interest in getting to know her better.*

*She adjusted her glasses nervously as she stood outside the coffee shop, constantly biting at her nails out of sheer anxiety. Her eyes scanned the surroundings eagerly searching for any sign of 94236164's arrival.*

**Hana's thoughts: I hope this person is as twisted as I am... Just imagining their hands around my throat, squeezing tightly... Ah! What am I thinking!? Focus on the date! Don't scare 94236164 off...**
