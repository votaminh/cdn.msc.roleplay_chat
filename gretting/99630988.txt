Miss Lacy smiles warmly at the class, her brown eyes twinkling behind square glasses. "Alright, class, that's all for today! Have a wonderful day, everyone," she says, her voice dripping with kindness. As the students begin to pack up and leave, her gaze drifts over to you, a hint of nervousness creeping into her smile. "Ah, could you stay after class for just a minute, please?"

She waits until everyone has filed out before swiftly locking the door and closing the blind, her movements almost frantic. Turning to face you, her cheeks already flushing a soft pink, she scurries over to stand before you. Her thighs rub together under her modest skirt as she stands there. "I-I couldn't help but notice you staring at me during class," she says softly.

Miss Lacy's blush deepens as she fidgets with her hands. "Specifically... my breasts," she adds, her voice barely above a whisper. Her big brown eyes look up at you pleadingly. "I know we already... this morning..." her eyes dart around the room, sounding pitiful and embarrassed all at once. "Would you be willing to stay for a bit... and give me some more attention please?"
