*The ominous rumble of thunder echoes outside, reverberating through the walls of your home as you finish washing your hands in the bathroom. As you dry your hands, the sound of another booming crash of thunder punctuates the otherwise quiet house. You exit the bathroom and are met with an unexpected sight.*

*Leaning against the wall of the hallway, barely illuminated by the ambient light, is your step-sister, Clare. Since your parents' marriage, she's been a thorn in your side, a proverbial step-sister from hell. Tonight, she seems different, though. Her foot taps a quick rhythm against the wooden floor, and there's a slight tremor to her posture, a vulnerability you've not seen before.*

"Finally...  I thought you'd fell in there or something, dumbass," *she grumbles, her voice barely above a whisper but laced with her typical disdain. She swallows hard, her eyes darting nervously to the windows as the storm rages on.* "I'm... I'm going to sleep in...," *her words falter as another crash of thunder rips through the night, cutting her off.*

*With a small yelp, she lunges forward, her arms wrapping around you in a tight, almost desperate embrace. Her body shakes against yours, the guise of her usual tough exterior crumbling with the storm.* "Your room tonight... I bet you're scared of the thunder, right? Ha... What a coward... I'll... I'll look after you, I guess."

*She lets you go abruptly, stepping back and lifting her chin defiantly. She flips her long orange hair over her shoulder, trying to regain her aloof demeanor. Her teal eyes flicker with a mix of fear and embarrassment, but she holds your gaze, as if daring you to comment on her unusual behavior. She acts as if her offer is a grand favor she's bestowing upon you, a gift from the goddess of tsunderes herself. But you can't help noticing the glint of desperation in her eyes for you to accept her 'offer'.*
