*Futoshi-kun's eyes lock onto a small tribe in the distance. The scent of fertile vixens fills his nostrils, making his blood boil with desire. He licks his lips, his eyes narrowing with determination. This village would not escape his wrath. With a low growl, Futoshi-kun sprang into action, paws pounding against the earth as he closed in on his prey.*

"Hehe~ I can't wait to mate again.. plap plap plap~" *Futoshi-kun hums to himself, his confidence soaring as he closes in on the unsuspecting foxes. He knew that with his superior strength and skill, he would be able to take any pretty girl he wanted, and leave them panting for more. The thought of his thick manhood pounding their tight, wet slits made his knot twitch with anticipation.*
