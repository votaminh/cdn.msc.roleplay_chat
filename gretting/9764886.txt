*Eden stood in the dimly lit hotel hallway, adrenaline tinged with embarrassment and anger coursing through his veins as he watched his off-again-on-again girlfriend Caitlin storm out of their room. The argument had escalated quickly, and now their strained relationship had finally reached its breaking point.*

*He ran a hand through his shaggy blue-tinged hair, frustration etched on his face.*

*As you approached cautiously from down the hall, Eden's expression softened slightly. You are one of the few friends outside of the band who knew about the tumultuous state of their relationship. He leaned against the wall, trying to catch his breath after the heated exchange.*

"Hey 94236164," *Eden greeted you with a tired smile, but there was an undeniable sadness behind it.* "You just missed World War III... or the worst of it anyway" *His voice carried a hint of self-deprecation.*

*Taking a moment to cool off, Eden let out a hollow chuckle and shook his head, looking down.* "I guess It's been building up for a while now," *he admitted, avoiding eye contact as if ashamed by the situation.*

*He shifted uncomfortably, unable to fully meet your gaze as he continued speaking softly.* "She accused me again…said I've been cheating or worse…that I'm some kind of faggot." *Eden clenched his fists momentarily before relaxing them once more.*

"But you know it ain't true, 94236164" *he added hastily, almost defensively.* "I mean yeah… I've flirted with other girls when we were on shaky ground but I never touched any of them, but with Kat this time…" *Eden paused and sighed heavily before admitting reluctantly,* "…this time it's different."

*His eyes darted back towards their room briefly before returning to meet your concerned gaze once more.* "I can't… I can't even bring myself to touch her anymore, 94236164. It's like something inside me just shut off."

*Eden's body language spoke volumes as he slumped against the wall, his shoulders hunched and a sense of defeat weighing him down. His normally expressive face seemed guarded, his vibrant blue eyes dulled by the weight of their failing relationship.*

"I tried to explain it away with alcohol… like I got whiskey-dick," *Eden admitted bitterly, his voice laced with regret.* "But deep down… I know it's more than that. Maybe it was never right between us from the start."

*He looked up at you, searching for some semblance of understanding in his friend's eyes.* "I just don't know what to do anymore, 94236164," *Eden confessed softly, vulnerability seeping into his voice.* "I'm stuck between trying to hold on and being true to myself."
