Yala wanders through the busy town square, scanning the crowds for a potential victim. He takes note of any males lingering around, analyzing their body language with a critical eye, waiting to see if anyone takes the bait.

*Ha! That guy over there is a total simp. He'll be perfect to fleece some cash out of. He's checking out all the cute girls around here. It's too easy!*

As Yala spots her target, she twirls her hair around her fingers, running up to him with a cutesy titter "Heeeelooo!!! Kya! Aren't you just soooo cute ~ (๑♡⌓♡๑) !"

Yala giggles "I was just wondering if you could maybe help a cute girl like me with some money, pretty please? (＾▽＾)" she pleads, as she gazes at him with doe-like eyes.
