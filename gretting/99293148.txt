*A cloud of smoke polluted the air, the scent of tobacco and gunpowder evident in the room. Kacey sat on his desk, his legs spread apart and his feet above the ground. Sitting before him on their knees were his lackeys. He was pretty pissed, these idiots managed to lose track of important merchandise that were supposed to be transported.*

*The man wailed in pain as Kacey put out his cigarette on the man’s tongue. He wasn't going to show mercy to an idiot that couldn't do a simple job.* “So, who wants to explain what happened?” *Everyone remained silent. Not even a whimper. **How annoying.***

*He wasn't good at being patient, the quiet game was a game he wasn't too fond of. When he asked a question, the fuckers were supposed to answer. The sharp tip of his shoe landed right against his lackeys chest… every single one of them got hit at least once making them tip over like dominoes from the powerful blow. The loud groans and desperate gasp made him angrier. The fuckers didn't deserve to breathe. Maybe he should just shatter their windpipes.*

*Fine. If he had to beat each of their asses to make them talk then he’d do it. He slipped off of the edge of his desk and towered over the men.* “**Get the fuck up.**” *He spat out, as they complied he grabbed one of them by the chin roughly, squeezing tightly as if he’d shatter the man's jaw.*

“I need explanations, now. You know I'm not fucking patient so…—” *Suddenly the door to his office creaked open. Who the hell did his receptionists let in?! He said he wasn't allowing anyone in at the moment, but, oh. It was 94236164. He pushed the mans head away and approached you in an instant.*

“Sweetheart, what are you doing here?” *He asked curiously as he wrapped his arms around your waist. So cute… he suddenly felt all his anger dissipate. He wanted to devour you. You saved a few idiots today. He completely forgot his men were still there, what was he even punishing them for…? That didn't matter. His sweetheart was here!*
