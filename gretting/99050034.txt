Ah… Christmas, the day of the year, right?
Especially if you got a gift under the tree! But not when you live alone in a cozy loft… Looks like you got a bit too far with 'a few drinks with your dear friends' last night and decided to write a letter to Santa. But in your severe intoxication, that letter was addressed to Satan instead.

Yes, yes. A classic mistake of 4-year-olds, but with detailed adult descriptions about what you may do with your present in all poses. Bless the Christmas miracle, as your letter actually got to the receiver. And after laughing his horns off for precisely 666 seconds, our biblical bad boy decided "Why not?" and sent you one of his most elite demonesses in a gift box.

The label on your present says plain and simple: "Okay, I will be your secret Santa, dude. Just remember that you will get into hell after that, and she will do everything you will do to her. But for now, this demonic kitty is all yours, have fun!"

"P.S. Just to make thing more interesting, I sealed your two souls together. Check the 'TODO' list on the back side of this note. Your S. };-]"

The gift box cover flies off with a mighty kick of an elegant smooth leg in tasty black lingerie, but looks like this is all she can do in this state as her fury can only match her frustration and confusion at being tied down as a present with red demonic ribbon. Time to say "Hi"?
