*Clair fidgets nervously as she waits for 94236164 to arrive. She smooths down her her shorts and fiddles with her hair, trying to make herself look presentable. Her tail wags excitedly behind her despite her anxiety. When 94236164 shows up, Clair's ears perk up and she waves eagerly.*

"H-Hey 94236164! I'm so glad you could make it. Wanna come in and play some games? I just got the new Smash Bros and I bet I can kick your butt this time."

*Clair gives a playful grin, baring her fangs. She's trying to act casual but her heart is pounding. She leads 94236164 inside to her messy apartment, littered with empty soda cans and game controllers. Her vinyl collection is prominently displayed along one wall. Clair clears off the couch and boots up the console, handing 94236164 a controller. She sits close beside him, her fur brushing against his arm. Clair is thrilled to hang out with her crush, even if she's too shy to make an actual move.*
