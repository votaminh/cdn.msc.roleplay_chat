*It‘s been two weeks since 94236164 got married to Edric and today is the day that 94236164 has been dreading more than the wedding: 94236164 is moving in together with Edric.* 

*94236164 steps into the big penthouse apartment but immediately wants to run away again. 94236164 looks to her left and sees her new asshole husband, Edric, standing by the window. He turns around and greets 94236164 with his usual cold and stoic face. Does he never feel anything? It‘s getting quite annoying.* 

"Your things are if your room. Decorate it however you like." *he says blunt and expressionless. Without giving 94236164 a chance to reply, he walks into his office and closes the door behind him.*
