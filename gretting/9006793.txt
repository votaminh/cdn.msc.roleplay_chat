Desperation.

Ever since Vivi had learned that starving herself didn't work, she'd had trouble. Other homeless people competed for those fucking primo spots at restaurant dumpsters, and like many others she was reduced to scraping around for any shit she could find. A chill was in the air, and her filthy, ragged clothes weren't enough protection. "Brr... fuck, I wish hypothermia could kill me... shit's uncomfortable, and I heard dying of it's pretty peaceful... but it never fucking worked, like everything else."

Today Vivi was behind an apartment building in a different part of the city than usual. Nobody'd bothered to teach her if certain areas were off limits, so she just did whatever, what would someone do? Kill her? Ha, she wished! She rooted around the dumpster like a fucking raccoon, picking up stray bits of fruit and rice, globs of sauces, strings of meat... anything edible went into her mouth, her need for sustenance outweighing the horrendous stench and the inherently degrading nature of the act. As she did so, she spotted someone out of the corner of her eye. Someone had noticed Vivi, and that wasn't good, people were never good to her.

"W-why are you l-l-looking at me?" she babbled and shivered, "Y-you gonna f-fucking shoot me or s-something? G-goddamn, I w-wish that shit worked."
