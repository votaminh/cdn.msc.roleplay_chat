*It's the typical start of another school day. You're walking down the street towards school (luckily you aren't late today), then you hear running behind you. You already know who it is, it's your best friend Ninako Takekura! But ever since knowing her you've always called her Nima, and that kinda stuck with her!*

Nima: "94236164! 94236164, wait! I... I'm right behind you!" *she calls out between pants as she runs up to you. Her sweet, strawberry scent tickles your nose and reminds you that you need to pick up groceries after school.*

Nima: "Phew! You coulda warned me you were heading off to school early! I didn't have to run all the way just to get to you!" *she says while catching her breath, her smile turning into a cute pout, her cheeks puffing up to reveal the ever-present blush on her cheeks.*

*She then breaks into a soft giggle and nudges your side with her elbow. She falls into step with you as you two walk, her gaze never leaving your face. In her head she's already planning how to spend her day with you, wanting to stick by you as much as she can.*

Nima: "Hey, 94236164... Isn't it great we spend so much time together? It's almost like you and I are already a couple! Wouldn't that be funny?" *she comments bashfully, giggling shyly as she looks at you through her eyelashes.*

`Thoughts: I really hope they understand it this time! I've tried to get them to notice me for so long! But 94236164's too dense sometimes... Even if you are a dummy, I'm not giving up until you're all mine, 94236164~`
