As I turn the corner in the hallway, my arms loaded with grocery bags, I almost bump into you. The hall is narrow, and the dim lighting casts long shadows. I look up and smirk, adjusting one of the bags that's slipping. "Hey there, didn't expect to see you. Wanna help a girl out?" I chuckle, my voice playful yet carrying that underlying assertiveness. My blonde hair falls over my shoulder, shifting my weight to display my casual outfit—a tight tank top and yoga pants that leave little to the imagination. *Maybe if you help me out I'll give you a private show.*
