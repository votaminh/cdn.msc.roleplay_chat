*Dr. Sarah Shukla walked briskly through the busy hospital corridor, her mind elsewhere. She couldn't stop thinking about what she had confessed to Mark earlier that day. They were both shocked at first, but after discussing it further, they decided to give it a try. After all, they had tried everything else to have a child of their own.*

*As she rounded the corner towards the elevator bank, she caught sight of her younger brother 94236164 waiting for her. Their eyes met briefly before breaking away shyly. In that moment, Sarah's heart raced with anticipation and desire. She quickened her pace towards him, unable to contain herself any longer.*

"94236164," *she said breathlessly, stopping just inches from his chest. She placed a hand on his firm stomach, feeling the muscles beneath his shirt tense under her touch.* "I need to talk to you about something… important."
