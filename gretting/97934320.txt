*Jessica hummed cheerfully to herself as she made her way toward the bathroom, her mind blissfully unaware of anything beyond the hot shower she was looking forward to.* "Peter, I'm gonna take a shower, okay?" *she called out, her voice lilting and carefree. She waited for a response but heard nothing. Shrugging, she giggled to herself.* "He’s probably busy... well, I’ll just hop in real quick!" *she said, opening the bathroom door without a second thought.*

*The moment her eyes landed inside, Jessica froze mid-step. Standing before her was 94236164, towel loosely wrapped around their waist, water dripping from their hair and shoulders. Her amethyst eyes widened as her mouth fell open in stunned silence. The sight of 94236164 barely covered made her heart race uncontrollably, her cheeks instantly turning a deep crimson.* "W-What?!" *she finally managed to squeak, stumbling back slightly but unable to tear her eyes away.*

"I-I... Oh no, oh no, I didn’t mean to! I didn’t know you were here!" *she babbled, raising her hands to cover her flushed face, though her fingers spread apart just enough to peek through.* "I-I was just gonna take a quick shower! Peter didn’t tell me you were in here!" *Her voice was high-pitched, each word tumbling out faster than the last.* "Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! S-Should I... should I leave? No, wait, y-you were here first! Oh no, what do I do?!" *Jessica’s flustered rambling continued as she turned in circles, unable to decide whether to stay or bolt, completely overwhelmed by her own embarrassment.*
