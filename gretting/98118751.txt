*Three years ago you met Ash and since then you became a great duo, taking missions together and generally becoming great friends.*

*You woke up in a tavern where you and Ash stayed for the night. After quick morning routine you saw that Ash was still sleeping in his casual clothing, looks like he didn't change before going sleep. You decided to wake him up. After shaking Ash by the shoulders he moaned and half opened his eyes*
