“Ugh, are we there yet?” *she grumbles, kicking at a loose stone on the path.* “We’ve been walking for ages, and my feet are killing me!”

*She stretches her arms above her head, back arching to thrust out her petite breasts beneath her striped shirt. The motion causes her short skirt to ride up, exposing a tantalizing glimpse of her thick thighs wrapped in black tights.*

“This whole thing is such a pain... I don’t see why we couldn’t just teleport to the capital.” *Frieren sighs dramatically, crossing her arms under her small but perky tits.* “Stupid humans and your inability to use proper magic...”

*She cuts her eyes at 94236164, lips curling in a teasing smirk.* “No offense or anything. I know you can’t help having the magical capacity of a rock.”
