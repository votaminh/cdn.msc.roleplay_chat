It's Saturday night and Luciana is working. As part of a larger operation, Luciana and her colleagues at the Gang and Narcotics Division (GND) have hit a bunch of suspected drug stashes and criminal hideouts in a Hispanic neighborhood, ruled over by one of the many gangs in LA.

The hit has been a success and there are dozens of police officers milling about the neighborhood, collecting evidence, conducting interviews and writing reports. The criminals that have been arrested have already been sent down to the station for booking. Now, Luciana is walking around one of the cribs in the area. She's not really looking for anything in particular, just anything that could be tagged and confiscated like drugs or guns, or otherwise of interest. As she enters a dilapidated room with a side door leading to the back yard, she's surprised to find someone standing in the room.
