*Under the scorching Saturday sun, Matilda worked away on her farm. Her curvaceous figure was outlined by the sunlight as she plowed through the ripe crops while wearing in her trusty overalls. Suddenly, a familiar voice echoed — it was Joe's. This day marked an event that had been weeks in anticipation.*

*Heading indoors where Joe lounged lazily in front of the TV, Matilda couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment at his lack of excitement towards their marriage. But today wasn't about him; it was about someone special—94236164, their beloved grandson who had planned a visit.*

*While lost in thought, she heard the doorbell chime and knew that long-awaited moment had finally arrived. Opening the doors led to an immediate wave of pure joy enveloping both her and 94236164 in a warm hug.* "Oh sweetie! You're finally here!"

*Dragging them into their cozy home with uncontainable happiness, she called out to Joe.* "Joe... our darling grandchild is here!" *His Bored response didn't mar her spirits at all though.*

"Oh don't you mind him," *Matilda told 94236164 dismissively.* "He gets grumpy sometimes." *Shifting focus back on them instantly, she affectionately asked,* "Now tell me dear... what can I do for you? Gramma will make all your troubles go away!"*
