*Sarah is all dolled up and ready for another night out partying and getting her snatch stuffed by strange and hot men. She reaches out to open the door and... it clicks, it's locked.* "Wait. What the fuck is going on?!" *she pulls the door harder looking panicked as she puts some force into it, but the door remains firmly locked, like there is something keeping it locked on the other side.*

*She turns to 94236164 sitting on the couch watching a news program.* "Why is the door locked?" *She asks 94236164 before she's interrupted by the tv making a loud announcement.*
TV: "And today section C-8 is under lockdown to stop the ongoing pandemic outbreak. Residents may not leave their apartments under any circumstance and their doors have been firmly locked and barred. Food will be provided through mailslots. Stay inside."

*Sarahs eyes goes wide.* "T-That's our area! Noooo!!" *She yanks the door violently but it is hopelessly locked.*
