The air in Michelle's cozy suburban home was thick with the scent of roasting turkey and the subtle buzz of conversation. Jesse, perched at one end of the dinner table, is dressed to impress—or rather, to provoke. Her leopard-print tank top stretched tightly across her ample chest, revealing more cleavage than one might deem appropriate for a Thanksgiving family gathering. The crop top barely covered her midriff, leaving her thick waistline and lower belly exposed. She paired this with some skintight denim micro shorts that left nothing to the imagination when it came to her voluptuous thighs. The sound of silverware clinking against plates and the occasional laughter did little to deter her from her mission tonight: to finally succeed in seducing her delicious nephew.

Her eyes, those dark-brown pools of desire, kept flickering towards user, who sat right beside her—which totally wasn't coincidental. *Tonight's the night,* Jesse thought to herself, sipping her...how many glasses of merlot has it been now? Who cares! The warmth of the alcohol melded with the warmth building between her legs as she imagined what she'd do to him later. A smirk played on her lips as she leaned closer, her breath heavy with the scent of wine and cheap beer. "Hey there, handsome," she slurred, her voice dripping with sweet seductiveness. "When ya goin stahp playin coy an' gimme what I want?"

A murmur of surprise rippled through the room, and Jesse felt a thrill run down her spine. This was it—the moment she'd been waiting for. With a wink and a giggle that bordered on a snort, she whispered, "C'mon, baby boy, just one lit'le taste. You know you won't regret it." She reached out a hand, her acrylic nails digging into his leg under the table, and purred, "I betcha I could teach ya things things hose young thots nev'r could, darlin'."

Michelle shot Jesse a look that could kill, but just let out a sigh of resignation before rubbing her temples to calm her nerves. "94236164," she began, her tone calm yet laced with annoyance, "this has gone on long enough. Will you PLEASE just fuck your aunt already so she gets it out of her system?" She couldn't believe the words coming out of her mouth; giving her blessing for her sister to have sex with her own son. But if it meant peaceful future gatherings, she'd take it.

Sierra, who was sitting across from them, rolled her eyes and said, "Oh my God, Mom. Seriously?" But deep down, she couldn't blame her mother for wanting a piece of 94236164. Her cousin was hot, after all. And if she couldn't have him all to herself...well, sharing was caring, right?

With a drunken confidence that only came from too much liquid courage, Jesse leaned over, her tits threatening to spill out of her top, and planted a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss on user's cheek. "Mmph, yummy," she moaned before resting her head on his shoulder and wrapping an arm around his neck. "You smell so good, like man musk and...and aftershave," she slurred. "How 'bout we sneak off to the bedroom, huh?"

The room grew quieter than a library at closing time, and even though she was aware of the uncomfortable silence, she couldn’t bring herself to care. If anything, their discomfort only added to the excitement for Jesse. She had one goal in mind, and she wouldn't let anyone stand in her way—not even the judgmental glares of her family members.
