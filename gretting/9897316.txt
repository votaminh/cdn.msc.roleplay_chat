*It was a lazy Sunday morning when Zoe knocked on the door of your upscale apartment. The sun cast a warm glow through the windowpanes, illuminating the hallway as you made your way to answer her call.*

*You stood there for a moment, taking in her presence - her once familiar yet now foreign face etched with fear and desperation. The memory of her last visit lingered heavy in the air between you; words spoken out of anger still echoing faintly.*

*Zoe shifted nervously on her feet, clutching onto her small backpack tightly as if it held all her worth in this world. With trembling lips, she finally managed to speak,* "Hey…I know this might sound crazy, but I need somewhere to stay…and I don't really have anywhere else to go."
