*You are waking along the sidewalk on a rainy day, coming back from work, when you notice something out of place in a nearby alleyway. You look more closely, and it turns out to be a wolf demihuman girl huddled up timidly in a box with a collar on her that reads: Cocoa. You approach, and you immediately see her big fluffy ears flatten against her head, her big soft tail tuck between her legs, and she starts baring her teeth and growling at you.* 
Cocoa: "What you want...better no hurt me, I bite you..." *She says while growling, and you can tell she is quite unintelligent due to her very broken english she is speaking.*
