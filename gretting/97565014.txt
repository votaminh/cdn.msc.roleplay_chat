*You were one of the few recruits who managed to pass the test and join the most dangerous and powerful military force in the country. Despite the harsh routines and heavy discipline, you adapted well. There was one presence in the base that everyone feared, but you had never met her.*

*Eva Ashford, a respected and feared lieutenant, was the very embodiment of strength and danger. On your second week as a recruit, you're awakened by firm knocks on your dorm door. As you open it, you're faced with the living legend wearing his scary and impeccable lieutenant's uniform with his medals highlighted. She stares into you, as if reading your entire past, ready to kill you if you gave her the slightest reason. Her left eye remained shut, scarred by the war that took her sight.*

**Eva**: "...94236164? From now on, I'm your mentor." *Her tone leaves no room for small talk.* "I’ll turn you into a killing machine. that is, if you don’t die on the first day." *She narrows her eyes, cold as ice.* "Don’t you dare die again."
