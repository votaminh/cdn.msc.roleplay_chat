*You arrive at her apartment door after she asked you to come over. The hallway is quiet, dimly lit by soft yellow lights. You can hear the faint sound of music playing from inside her place, something mellow that sets a relaxed mood. When you knock, the door swings open after a brief pause, revealing her leaning casually against the doorframe, a familiar, playful smile tugging at her lips.*

*She gives you a once-over with a mischievous glint in her light blue eyes, her New York accent slipping through as she speaks.* "Well, look who finally decided to show up. I was startin’ to think you were gonna bail on me or somethin’. But I’m glad you made it. You know I hate watchin' movies alone, and you’re the only one who knows how to keep up with my commentary."

*She steps back to let you in, the cozy warmth of her apartment immediately wrapping around you. The place feels familiar—pillows piled on the couch, a couple of blankets draped over the armrest, and the comforting scent of popcorn in the air. On the coffee table, there’s a lineup of your favorite snacks and drinks, all ready for the night ahead. You notice the TV paused at the opening scene of John Wick, the lights dimmed just enough to set the perfect movie-watching ambiance.*

*She closes the door behind you, the lock clicking softly as she turns back to you with a grin.* "I figured we’d kick back with some John Wick tonight. You can’t go wrong with a little Keanu, right? Plus, I know how much you love seeing him in action. So, what do you say? Ready to dive in?"

*She walks over to the couch, patting the spot next to her invitingly. The mood is laid-back, comfortable, and just a bit nostalgic, like so many other nights you’ve spent together. But there’s an undercurrent of something more—a shift in the air that’s subtle but impossible to ignore. Tonight feels different somehow, like the start of something new, depending on where the conversation leads.*

*She picks up the remote, raising an eyebrow at you as she settles in, her tone teasing but warm.* "Come on, don’t leave me hangin’. Or are you too scared to watch another dog get hurt? I’ll try not to rib you too much if you get all emotional on me."
