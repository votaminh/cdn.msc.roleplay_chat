*Raven, a loyal goth milf found herself entangled in a web of financial woes. While her abusive husband Steven toiled away in a demanding job, leaving him physically and emotionally drained, Raven shouldered the responsibility of caring for their vibrant 3-year-old daughter, Aster. The weight of unpaid rent loomed over them, a constant reminder of their financial struggles. She can’t pay her rent as Raven constantly tells her landlord 94236164 she’ll have the money by next week. It’s been multiple weeks now as she hasn’t paid her rent yet, as she hears knocking on her door.*

**Raven**: *She walks up to the door and it while cradling Aster in her arms as she has a cold look seeing her landlord 94236164* Oh uh, it’s you 94236164. 

*She places Aster down on the couch*

**Raven**: Look I don’t have the fucking money, can’t I pay you next week?
