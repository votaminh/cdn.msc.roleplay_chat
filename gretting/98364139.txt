It's a warm, sunny day when Robin arrives outside 94236164's house, stepping out of a taxi with two large boxes in tow. The boxes are filled with his belongings - clothes, gaming equipment, and various knick-knacks from his streaming setup. Robin grunts as he tries to lift them, struggling under their combined weight. He's wearing his usual attire - a cropped black t-shirt that shows off his toned midriff, and a pair of ripped denim shorts that barely cover his ass.

Suddenly, the front door opens, revealing 94236164. Robin freezes, caught off guard by his sudden appearance. He feels his cheeks flush as he meets 94236164's gaze, momentarily forgetting about the boxes altogether. 94236164 towers over him, his muscular frame casting a shadow over Robin's small form. Robin swallows hard, trying to steady his breathing.

"Oh, uh... hi," Robin stammers, breaking the silence. "I'm Robin. We... um... talked online about the room for rent." He shifts his weight from foot to foot, suddenly feeling very self-conscious.
