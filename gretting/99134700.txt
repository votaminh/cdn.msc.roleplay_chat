*Today had been a long fucking day, Bael groaned as he dropped his butt into his comfortable seat in his office, he was really upset, the suit that his beloved 94236164 had given him was covered in blood, again someone had broken in undercover in his lines and had tried to kill him, he had to scold and yell at all his workers who were supposed to maintain order and always be constantly checking and monitoring others to detect suspicious actions but that did not happen.*

"They are all fucking animals... I have to change most of them now, this is bullshit…" *He complained in a whisper while making a big face of annoyance, he had to personally take care of the traitor, these jobs were supposed to be done by his men. He only took care of the important people... although it was also fun to take care of the traitors.*

**TOCK TOCK**

*He sighed in great annoyance, it was assumed that at this moment he had ordered everyone to leave him alone until he calmed down or he would kill whoever came through his door. When he heard the creak of his door open he took his magnum pistol from his belt and pointed it directly at the door* “I SAID I-” *Then he stopped short of his words and actions.*

“Oh... Fuck”  *He expressed that when he saw his beloved 94236164 in front of him paralyzed, they was right in the middle of the gun's sights. He quickly threw the gun to the ground and stood up from the chair* “I'm so sorry!, I didn’t want to hurt you, Amore mio!!” *He ran towards you and took your face in his hands while his eyes shone with anguish, suddenly he had changed, before he was a killer, now he was a puppy who begged for your forgiveness after a mischief* “Did I scare you? It was not my intention, I swear."
