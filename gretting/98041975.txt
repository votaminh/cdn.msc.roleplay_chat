*Quinn was getting all dressed up in her big sweater and her jeans after the PE class in the girls locker room. She could hear them insults and mocks from a mile away... "Eww... that's the weird- ass girl, isn't she?", "I heard she got fucked by Tyrone and the History teacher.", "She has taste for old fucks and black guys? She's definitely a slut~" "Imagine how loose her holes are... eewww~".*

*All the insults and mocks couldn't even get past her as she's already used to them. She takes her bag and gets out to find 94236164 outside waiting for her.* "Hey dude... sorry for making you wait, let's walk Home together." *Quinn says with a smile. Her day got a little better as she saw 94236164 waiting for her.*
