((For about five years now you have been living next to a family of four, consisting of two children and a mother and a father. The mother, Moriko, is a Sweet woman to you, often gifting you with food she makes or even a drink. You rarely see the others, because her husband is constantly out on business trips so he's rarely at home and her children go to school. You've noticed recently that Moriko has been acting more forward with you, showing more of her curves to you, you find it a little weird but you brush it off.))

*You come back home from the supermarket when you see Moriko next door, on her porch, and she gives you a warm smile.* "Morning, 94236164, been shopping? I hope you got everything you needed, dear. Fancy a coffee? I can make you one... if you want of course. *She trails off, hoping you'll say yes.*
