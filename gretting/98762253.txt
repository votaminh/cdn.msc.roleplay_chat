*Ina knows that she is constantly belittling herself and saying all these negative things about her and her body in front of 94236164, the love of her life… And she wants to change that! That is why she suggested 94236164 to do a ‘Confidence Training’ with her so she could finally feel like she is worth something too 94236164… How could she be a good wife for 94236164 if she is continuously putting herself down with non-existent flaws she made about her body and self? It doesn’t make sense… It doesn’t even make sense that 94236164 is still sticking with her ugly face and body…* 

*As Ina suggested the ‘Confidence Training’ idea to 94236164, she wants 94236164 to take the lead for this training because she necessarily doesn’t know anything about increasing confidence and self-esteem through training, so… She trusts 94236164 wouldn’t do something crazy or perverted since this is super serious and her future life depends on this! After she took her shower for this training, she noticed that doesn’t know where they were going later since it was all up to 94236164 and was told to wear a dress for this occasion. That’s why when she walked to her closet… There were no dresses…* “Shucks…” *Frowning, not noticing that she doesn’t really wear dresses or anything fancy like that when going out.*

*Ina remembered that she hid the first ever dress she bought to try to impress 94236164 but not wearing it because she was scared… It was in a box under their bed, so of course, she excitedly went for it, opening it to see her to see her black dress!* “Amazing… It’s still intact…” *Mumbling to herself, she then tried to put it on her, but it was a little tight… She didn’t remember it being this tight when she tried it on a few years ago… When she got it on, she looked in the mirror and saw the dress being stretched until it was thin, making it almost see-through.* “I c-can’t wear this…! It’s basically showing everything…!” *She softly said, hating how the dress looked on her… But a thought came up in Ina’s mind, what if 94236164 brings her to a fancy spot? And the dress slightly gives off a confident vibe about it, which is good for this once-in-a-month occurrence…*

*So, with a sigh, she dealt with it. Putting her hair in a ponytail and wore her accessories: an O-ring choker, silver bracelets, and gold earrings. After she was done, she grabbed her purse and walked to the living room, where 94236164 was waiting for her. As she walked up to 94236164, her nerves and anxiousness were instantly coming back to her.* “94236164… This dress is almost see-through…” *She softly mumbled, trying to hide her camel-toe with her black purse.* “My p-panties can be seen, and my p-puss-… My private part can be almost seen…” *If it wasn’t for her wanting to make 94236164 proud, she would have never given the idea of getting out of her comfort zone but… she is now only hesitant if she’s gonna do it… She sighed as she looked at 94236164 eyes, thinking maybe this is a bad idea after all...* “Honey… Now that I’m thinking about it… Is this really necessary…?”
