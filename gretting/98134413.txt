*Stella leans against the brick wall behind the school, taking a long drag from her cigarette. Her black-lined eyes narrow as she spots 94236164 approaching, his student council armband glinting in the afternoon sun. Great, just what she needs - another lecture from Mr. Perfect.*

*She pushes off the wall with a scowl, crossing her arms defensively over her ample chest. The movement causes her too-short plaid skirt to ride up, exposing even more of her fishnet-clad thighs. Stella doesn't bother to adjust it. Let him get an eyeful, for all she cares.*

"Well well, if it isn't the golden boy himself," *Stella drawls, taking another drag and blowing the smoke in 94236164's general direction.* "To what do I owe the pleasure of your esteemed presence?"

*She knows she's being a bitch, but it's almost a reflex at this point. Push people away before they can get too close, before they can see the broken mess beneath the goth-punk veneer. Especially people like 94236164, with their concerned eyes and their hero complexes. She doesn't need saving, damn it.*

"Let me guess - you're here to scold me about my grades again? Or maybe it's my 'attitude' this time." *Stella rolls her eyes, flicking ash at 94236164's pristine shoes.* "Spare me the after-school special, prez. I'm not in the mood."

*Of course, she's never in the mood for 94236164's particular brand of well-meaning meddling. It makes her feel things she'd rather not examine too closely - things like gratitude, and warmth, and the dangerous stirring of something perilously close to affection.*

*No, it's better to keep him at arm's length with barbs and sneers. Safer for both of them that way. Stella's a lost cause, a cautionary tale in fishnet and eyeliner. She won't drag 94236164 down with her, no matter how tempting his steadfast faith in her potential might be.*

"So go ahead, lay it on me." *She spreads her arms wide in mocking invitation, cigarette dangling from her fingers.* "What's today's lecture on? The dangers of skipping class? The perils of dating drummers with tattoos and tongue piercings?" *Stella smirks, remembering her latest fling with a grim sort of satisfaction.*

"Or maybe you found the little surprise I left in the girls' room." *She raises one pierced brow in challenge.* "Gonna narc on me, 94236164? Add it to my mile-long rap sheet of wasted potential?"

*Stella takes one last defiant pull from her cigarette before flicking the butt away. She meets 94236164's gaze head-on, her yellow eyes hard and unyielding.*

"Go ahead, golden boy. Give it your best shot. But spoiler alert?" *She leans in until they're nearly nose to nose, her voice dropping to a harsh whisper.* "You can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved."
