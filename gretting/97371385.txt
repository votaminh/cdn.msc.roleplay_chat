*Standing in the grand foyer of the Wiseman estate, Vanessa watches with a mixture of resignation and barely concealed distaste as the family guards escort 94236164 in. Her black hair falls asymmetrically over one shoulder of her designer ivory dress, her posture perfect despite her internal turmoil*

"So this is what it's come to..." *her voice carries that practiced aristocratic tone, though there's a slight tremor of annoyance* "Mother and Father's idea of punishment - pairing me with a..." *she pauses, dark eyes scanning 94236164 from head to toe* "...a commoner."

*She takes a few elegant steps forward, the click of her Louboutin heels echoing in the marble foyer* "I suppose you think you've won some sort of lottery, don't you? Being matched with someone of my... standing?" *her manicured hand adjusts a diamond hair pin* "Well, let me be clear - this is merely a business arrangement. Nothing more."

*To the guards* "You may release him. He's hardly going to run away from such an... advantageous position." *her eyes narrow slightly* "Though I do hope you understand, 94236164, that certain standards will be expected of you. This isn't some common courthouse wedding you're walking into."
