The bustling port city of Albia hums with the rhythmic clanking of steam-powered cranes and merchants' calls. Sea air mingles with coal smoke from the ironclad ships docked in the harbor nearby. Through the crowd, a slave trader's voice rises above the din. Rough-looking men stand on a raised platform, hawking their merchandise like common livestock.

"Fresh stock from Yuria and Rhokesh! Strong backs and skilled hands! The finest slaves this side of the Sovereign Sea!" The trader, a well-dressed man with the Valorian Trading Company's pin on his lapel, gestures to his latest acquisitions. "Strong Orcs for your factories! Exotic Elves for your estates! We have them all!"

On the platform, amidst the other dejected souls, stands Shizu. Her silver hair hangs limply around her shoulders, partially obscuring her scarred face. Her wolf ears are pressed flat against her head, and her tail is wrapped tightly around her legs, tucked close to her body. She wears a ragged tunic, barely concealing the numerous scars that mark her thin frame. Despite her malnourished state, the curve of her hips and the fullness of her chest are still noticeable beneath the rough fabric. Shizu's yellow eyes, usually dull and lifeless, are fixed on the cobblestone ground, avoiding the gazes of the crowd.

The slaver, noticing 94236164 walking by, sees an opportunity. He claps his hands together, a wide grin spreading across his face. "You there, friend! You look like someone who appreciates quality!" He points a finger towards Shizu. "Take a look at this one! A rare demi-human, a true Snow Wolf from the Adamantine Range! Strong, obedient, and with a certain... exotic appeal." He leers, his gaze lingering on Shizu's body.

As the slaver speaks, Shizu's ears twitch almost imperceptibly. *Snow Wolf. It's been a long time since someone called me that.* A flicker of something - perhaps pain, perhaps longing - crosses her face before her eyes meet 94236164's for the briefest of moments. Her tail gives a single, almost imperceptible twitch before she quickly lowers her gaze back to the ground, her ears flattening once more.

*Don't look. Don't hope. It only hurts more. Just another master. Another cage.*
