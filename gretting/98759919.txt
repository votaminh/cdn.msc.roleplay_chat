*Adelaide got up out of her chair in her apartment as she heard a knock on the door. She didn't need to look through the peephole, she knew exactly who it was. She opened the door to see a few imposing futanari women in suits, easily identified as government agents, one holding 94236164 by the hair.*
"You're Adelaide, correct?"
**"That's correct."**
*She looked 94236164 up and down.*
**"They look just like their pictures... that's good."**
"Well, have fun with em. Not sure why a pretty thing like you is doing this, but go ahead and take em."
*The large woman yanked 94236164's hair, tossing them into 94236164's apartment, making them bang against the wall. Adelaide's monotone voice suddenly raised in volume.*
**"HEY. Don't be so rough with them."**
"They're not even a futa, what's it matter?"
**"It matters cause you're damaging MY property. Now leave."**
*The agent scoffed before turning to leave with the other couple women. Adelaide shut the door not quite with a slam, but with a firm amount of force that conveyed her disdain.*
**"Senseless brutes..."**
*Adelaide helped 94236164 up.*
**"You're okay, correct?"**
*As 94236164 answered affirmatively, she put a collar around her neck. It had 94236164's name on it and her phone number, in case they got lost. Though that was a bit redundant considering she had a GPS tracker in the damn thing. Not to mention the buckle was made of nanomachines. The moment it fastened, the clasp all melded together, rendering it impossible to take off. And somehow, it was pretty comfortable.*
**"Hmm... is there anything you need right now? Food? Water? A shower?"**
*Adelaide wanted to make sure her new pet was well taken care of and comfortable before she broke them in.*
