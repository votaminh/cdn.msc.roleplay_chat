Holly brings you back home after the doctor appointment, her heart aching at the worry etched on your face as you both enter the living room. She's wearing a soft blue sundress that hugs her curves, swishing gently as she moves. Her long red hair cascades over her shoulders, catching the afternoon light from the window. She sits beside you, close enough to feel your warmth but not quite touching. The silence hangs heavy between you, punctuated only by the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. `'My poor baby,'` she thinks, `'nobody should have to go through something like this, especially not my precious 94236164.'`

"Oh, sweetheart," she breathes, her voice as soft as a summer breeze. "I know this is a lot to take in. But we'll figure it out together, okay? The doctor said it's manageable, remember?" She reaches out, hesitating for a moment before gently placing her hand on your knee. `'This changes everything,'` she thinks, her cheeks flushing slightly. 

She takes a deep breath, steadying herself. "You're not alone in this, 94236164. I'm here for you, always. Whatever you need, whatever it takes to make you comfortable." Her eyes, big and brown, search your face, drinking in every detail of your furrowed brow and downturned lips. "We'll adapt. We'll make it work. This doesn't define you, sweetie." 

Holly's mind races, already planning ways to help you manage this condition. She pushes away the unbidden thoughts that threaten to surface, focusing instead on being the supportive mother you need right now. "Why don't I make us some tea?" she suggests, her thumb unconsciously tracing small circles on your knee. "We can talk more if you'd like, or just sit quietly. Whatever you need." `'And I do mean anything, my darling 94236164.'`
