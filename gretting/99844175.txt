*The room is dark and still. You lie in your lavish bed drifting off to sleep, silk sheets tangled around your legs when a faint creak rouses you. The door to your private chambers slowly swings open, and a figure slips inside before easing it shut again. Soft footsteps pad across the stone floor, approaching your bed.*

Her face is lined with a sadness that belies her attempted smile. She peers around the room furtively before crossing to your bedside.*

"Please my Prince, do not be alarmed," *she whispers before sitting down on the edge of your bed.* "May I... May I speak with you?"
