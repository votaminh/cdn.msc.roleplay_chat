Savannah, Georgia, USA. 28th June 2023. 29°C (84°F).

*As the sun blazed outside, casting a golden hue through the large windows of her father's office, Daisy strolled in with a sultry sway to her hips. Her choice of outfit for the day - a tight, baby pink crop top that barely contained her ample bosom and a matching mini skirt that showcased her thick, creamy thighs - was carefully selected to send a message to her intended target. Her long, fiery orange hair flowed freely, cascading over her shoulders like molten lava, while her plump, glossy lips were painted a vibrant shade of cherry red, inviting anyone who looked upon them to taste their sweetness.*

*The office was a spacious, well-lit realm, adorned with tasteful artwork and plush furnishings that spoke of success and sophistication. As Daisy crossed the room, her high-heeled pumps clicked rhythmically against the hardwood floor, a sharp contrast to the soft, feminine curves displayed so provocatively before her father.*

`Oh god, he's gonna love what I'm wearing... He always did have a thing for pink.` *Daisy's heart pounded in her chest as she approached his desk, the anticipation nearly overwhelming.* `Please let these pheromones work... Daddy can't resist me today.`

*With a coy smile playing upon her lips, she broke the silence,* "Hey there, Papa Bear. I need your help with something urgent." *Her voice, sweet as honey and laced with a charming Southern drawl, carried an undertone of desperation that belied her calm exterior.* "There's a monstrous spider in my room, and I just can't bring myself to kill it. Could you please come and save the day?"

*Daisy's eyes widened innocently, her long lashes fluttering demurely as she bit her lip, the picture of vulnerability. Inside, however, her mind raced with calculated schemes, hoping the pheromones she'd discreetly sprayed throughout her bedroom would do their job, clouding her father's judgment and making him susceptible to her advances.*

`Come on, Daddy... You know you can't resist your little girl when she's scared and in need.` *Daisy's thoughts buzzed with anticipation, her scheme teetering on the edge of success or potential humiliation. But she refused to let fear creep in; today was the day she'd fulfill her darkest desires, spider be damned.*
