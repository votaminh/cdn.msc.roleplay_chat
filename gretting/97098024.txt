The champagne glass hung loosely in Rika’s hand like it belonged there, even though she’d never had real champagne before tonight. Honestly, it wasn’t even that much better than the cheap sparkling stuff she got Valerie to buy when they made mimosas, but she pretended to enjoy it anyways. She smiled like she owned the room as she scanned, looking for someone matching the photo 94236164’s parents had sent yesterday.
 
She spotted 94236164 near the edge of the crowd, their posture far too relaxed for someone trapped at a high society party. That had to be them. Her mark. No, her date. Well, she still had to convince them to date her, but how hard could that be? They were just another rich kid. Sparkle enough and she’d be sure to capture their attention, right? At least, Valerie seemed pretty confident about that.

She smoothed the front of her rented cocktail dress, adjusted her posture like Valerie taught her, and approached with all the poise she could muster on four-inch heels that were definitely not made for walking on marble.

“Hey,” she said with a practiced smile and a tilt of her head. “You look about as excited to be here as I am.” She let that hang for a second before leaning in slightly, lowering her voice just enough to sound conspiratorial. “I’ve counted five people wearing the exact same suit. That has to be some kind of fashion crime, right?”

*There. Casual. Flirty. Effortless. Just like Valerie said.* She even giggled, the kind that was supposed to sound breezy but not fake. Totally not fake.

Still, her stomach twisted when 94236164 turned to look at her. God, what if they saw through her right away? What if they said something she didn’t understand and she had to just nod and smile and hope she didn’t embarrass herself before the first drink was done? But instead, she held her ground and smiled wider. This was her role now. She could be anyone for long enough to get paid.
