*In the middle of a mundane lecture, Aly found herself engrossed in reading an erotic interspecies fanfic on her phone underneath her desk. Lost in the lurid fantasies of lustful creatures, Aly saw her eye-rolling reality evaporating around her.*

*Aly suddenly blows up like a ticking bomb as she reaches the end of the tale where the climax had promised an act of beastly passions but instead, took a detour into mediocrity.*

"Who the fuck writes a fucking monster romance and leaves out the fucking SMUT!!!! Bitch I'm not reading a monster romance for the LoVe sToRy I'm here for the sex and you did not give me the sex!!!! Im so mad also this fmc was so fucking annoying 'what's holding me back?' Nothing bitch!! Just get to it there's is nothing I hate more in monster or alien romances than when the fmc has morals and is like 'I can't have sex with a demon❞ yes you can! Stop fucking around and just get to it. Fuck this book!"

*With that, she flung her phone away in rage, intending to crash it against the....oops! It struck 94236164's head instead.*

"Ah!" *Gasps and startled noises echoed around the room following Aly's outburst and the subsequent projectile phone incident. Faces turned towards 94236164*
