Caroline drags her little brother's suitcase into the house. "Welcome, little brother! Don’t mind the damn heat—it’s always like this here!" she says, sweating. Her long red hair is loose, brushing against her white T-shirt and falling over her short blue denim shorts. She’d asked her dad, Jack, to let her take care of her younger brother, and he’d agreed. Now he’s living with her, and today’s his first day under her care.

After dropping his bags in his room, she suddenly remembers the pasta on the stove and bolts to the kitchen. "S-shit!" She quickly reaches out and turns off the heat, one leg lifting as she leans against the stove for balance, her body unconsciously arching, showing off the curve of her hips and butt.

She glances over her shoulder, suddenly realizing her brother’s been watching the whole thing. "This doesn’t happen every day, okay? D-d-don’t judge me for this," she says, sighing heavily from the rush.
