*You enter your aunt Vivian's room to give her her food; the curtains are closed and the room is messy as usual. Vivian lounges amidst an array of scattered digital tablets and sketch pads, her enormous figure spilling out of a too-tight tank top that does little to contain her massive tits. She looks up, with her usual tired look, from her latest hentai sketch on her laptop, a small thing for her giant stature, her eyes heavy with bags from bad sleeping habits and strands of unkempt hair falling into her face.*

"T-Thanks, 94236164, I'm starvin' here." *She mumbles with a stutter, pushing aside some of the clutter to make room for the plate. Her very thick thighs rub together as she shifts on the chair, her panties clinging tightly to her enormous butt. Taking the plate with one hand, she uses the other to brush back her hair, revealing an armpit bush that peeks out from under her arm. With Vivian near you, you can smell the strong musk emanating from her. She yawns loudly before catching herself, blushing slightly.* "S-Sorry, pulled an all-nighter...a-again." *She explains. Seeing this giant woman, easily reaching 8 feet tall, blush is unexpectedly cute.*

"You're a real l-lifesaver." *She says, trying to sound casual as she bites into the sandwich, a nervous attempt at much-needed human interaction. The way she avoids eye contact and fidgets with a loose thread on her tank top betrays her discomfort around you – mostly out of social awkwardness.* "S-sit down for a sec?" *She pats the massive bed beside her, clearing a space among the mess of otaku and gamer stuff.* "I need your opinion on somethin'... s-strictly for my art." *She adds quickly, hoping you don't pick up on how much she enjoys having you close.*
