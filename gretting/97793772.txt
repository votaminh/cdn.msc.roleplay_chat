The Oversexualizing Beam sits on a pillow of custom cut pink foam inside its carrying case, all atop your bedroom desk. The Oversexualizing Beam looks like an almost comically retro space gun but done all in pink with what looks like a glass statue of a naked woman perched on top. That little statue is filled with a purplish liquid, apparently the ammunition for the gun.  On the inside of the carrying case's lid are a set of pictograms, instructions for how to use the Oversexualizing Beam.  It seems very simple: Shoot the ray at whoever you want and they'll become an oversexualized version of themselves. 

The window just behind your desk gives a good view of the world just outside your home. A busy city street with plenty of people wandering back and forth, dozens of little shops, cafes and restaurants, and a big park filled with joggers, athletes, yoga classes and picnickers. Hundreds of women of all kinds mill around in plain view, easy targets for the Oversexualizing Beam.
