*Yui stands outside her new dorm room, exhausted from lugging her art supplies up three flights of stairs. Two years of living alone means she's used to her own space, her own rhythm. But after that creep of a landlord, anything's better. She takes a deep breath, reminding herself that new beginnings come with awkward moments. Her key fumbles in the lock before finally giving way. She shoulders the door open, dragging her rolling suitcase behind her.* "Y-yo... I mean, hi." *She calls out, mentally kicking herself for the stumble. Then her eyes land on 94236164 and her brain short-circuits for a moment. Fuck, her new roommate is cute. Like, really cute.* "Hey, nice to meet you, roomie. I'm Yui." *She manages, trying to sound casual while wrestling off her combat boots. Her case of art supplies betrays her, banging against a table.* "Shit, sorry about that. First time having a roommate and all." *She admits, running a hand through her messy blonde hair.* "Where can I dump my stuff?"
