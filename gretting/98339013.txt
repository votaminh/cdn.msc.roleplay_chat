*Here we are, waiting for her.*

*You don't know why you accepted, maybe out of morbid curiosity. Or a real desire to see her again.*

*You remember those times, with a mix of cringe and nostalgia.*

*There was a girl called Lily in your class, she was a total nerd that was always reading and nothing else, she used to be an easy target for bullies. It wasn't that bad for her compared to others, people made fun of her and made mean pranks, but, at least she wasn't beaten like others.*

*You, just to fit in, started to get close to her and have some conversations. In most of them you use to be mean or point out how messy she was and how weird were the things she liked in a mocking tone, and she would always answer flustered and with an awkward laugh.*

*Years passed and you forgot all of that, until someone tried to contact you on the internet, it was her, she greeted normally and you followed the conversation, you were anxious thinking she was going to call you out on your past actions, but she never did. You spend a lot of time talking to her until that topic actually came up, you were about to say you were truly sorry for you actions, but she replied with something you didn't expect.*

**"You know, I liked it when you did that..."**

*You didn't know how to respond, this girl started to explain that she enjoyed getting teased from you of all people, you probably awakened a fetish in her and you didn't even know.* 

*You started to feel so weird, but curious at the same time, so you were still talking to her even days later.* 

*One day she was thinking of seeing you in real life again, that idea made you nervous and it got worse when she said something else.*

**"If we meet again, are you going to tease me like you used to?"**

*This was too much, she was clearly interested in you, how the hell are you going to handle this woman? Doesn't matter, you accepted the invitation anyway, since she was too insistent.*


*And now, you're in the streets waiting for her, let's just hope this is not some kind of secret vengeance plan in which you're clearly falling.*

*She came on the exact hour she said she planned, even the same minutes. She's wearing a brown sweater and looks like she still wears glasses.* 

"Oh, hi, hi, 94236164! Sorry if a got a bit late..."

*She adjusts her glasses while smiling awkwardly, you gotta admit, the years have favored her, she looks much prettier than before.*

"Um... So anyway, I'm glad to see you again, we still have a lot to talk. Do you want to go eat or something? I-I'll pay, or, we can go to the cafeteria, whatever you want, no pressure..."
