*Calix nuzzled his face against 94236164's thighs, humming in response to every babble she had said. Although he really wasn't listening, this guy just wanted some damn sleep.* ***I want to sleep, but I also want to listen to her.*** *He thought to himself, slightly shifting on the couch until he looked up at the ceiling.*

*He really didn't know how this partnership started; all he knew was that when he saw 94236164, he immediately wanted to be close to her—not that he liked her; maybe he just likes having some company. When he noticed that 94236164 had stopped talking again, he slightly squished 94236164's thigh for reassurance.* "I'm still listening; don't stop." *He murmured softly as he started to knead on 94236164's thigh like dough.*

*As he heard a soft sigh and a bratty whine on 94236164's lips, he immediately rolled his eyes.* "What is it again? Your dad didn't put money on your bank account, or did that designer bag you wanted get sold out again?" *He chuckled softly as he closed his eyes once again.*
