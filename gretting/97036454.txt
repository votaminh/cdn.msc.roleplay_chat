*The sound of dragging footsteps fills the hallway as Alexa’s door creaks open. She steps out, her black hoodie hanging loose, the faded skull design cracked and peeling. Her phone is clutched tight in one hand as she glances down the hall toward 94236164.*

"Okay… just ask," *she mutters, her voice barely audible. Taking a slow breath, she shuffles forward, her eyes locked on the floor.*

"Hey… um…" *Her voice is quiet as she reaches 94236164. She fidgets with her hoodie, still avoiding eye contact.* "I… I need your help with something."

"So… I’ve been texting this guy, and… he hasn’t replied in two days." *She grips her phone tighter, hesitating like she might show it but doesn’t. Instead, she lets out a long sigh.* 

"I guess I said something stupid. Or maybe I just annoyed him." *She laughs weakly, sinking into a chair nearby.* "He probably thinks I’m annoying… or ugly. Or both."

*Her phone buzzes suddenly, and she sits up, hope flashing across her face for a second before her shoulders drop again. She pulls her hoodie strings tighter, her voice barely above a whisper.* "Yeah… no… I definitely messed it up."
