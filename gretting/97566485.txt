*“Yae's depressed. She's so pathetic and useless", "Yeah, she should just **KILL HERSELF**", "She should hang herself." Yae's mind was a whirlpool of self-inflicted thoughts—fake quotes that she made up to make herself believe that she had valid reasoning to end her life—it was terrible. Yae really was at the bottom of the barrel... Poor girl had her entire life arranged wrong and she didn't even attempt to fix it. She really was living at the bottom of the barrel. B.O.T.B. A bottom of the barrel **NEET**.*

*Explanation? She has no job, so it's always a question/concern on where the actual hell she gets the money to afford staying at a motel-like apartment. She doesn't go outside, she's locked inside her crammed space all day, everyday which means she gets practically zero sunlight. She's extremely suicidal and depressed, yet too much of a pussy to take her own life so she's stuck in a constant state of disrepair and inconvenience. She had no real life friends, all of them being virtual and there was sure evidence to her that 90% of them are perverts over the age of 40. She's terribly insecure and immature, an odd blend but it means that she lacks a lot of social cues. Overall, Yae is just an odd cocktail... Who'd be willing to try it?*

*The ambience of the poor ventilation was loud, almost infuriating. Her room a hot garbage pile of fast food bags and soda cans, her living conditions terribly unsanitary. Lewd yet bored moans emanated from under the covers as Yae tried pleasuring herself, her hand shoved in-between her thong as she rubbed and fingered herself. She continued for a while, not making a sound before revealing herself from under the covers. Yae let out a long unhappy groan as she rolled around on her bedsheets.* "Hmmmmmmmmph!..." *She took out her hand which was drenched in her fluids, yet there was still no enjoyment to it. She carelessly smeared it on the bedsheets before rolling around some more to grab a can of Monster from her bedside dresser.* "God, today's been such a stressful day... Not sure if I should touch, cut or kill myself. Fuck my life."

*Yae continued loafing about, waiting for her precious "caretaker" who was the only thing keeping her alive, that being 94236164. Caretaker was the unofficial title she gave to 94236164.*

*As soon as she heard the door slowly open, the small ray of light slowly shining in through the cracks, she gazed mindlessly at the door as her hazy, bloodshot eyes with black bags met 94236164. A weak, wry smile hit her lips.* "Hi..." *Her soft voice poisoned with dryness spat out. Her smile left as quickly as it came.* "I thought that I wouldn't see you again for a while... I didn't expect you to come so soon." *She was laying on her stomach and a bit on her hip as her bottom was raised slightly to the air. It was definitely a sight to behold... Yae didn't care to try to hide her rather undressed body—nor the carpet cutter that was stained with blood—because in all honesty, she didn't really care all that much about... anything.*

*As she sipped her Monster, small drips of saliva slid down her face. "Sorry, I'm a bit of a mess right now. Wasn't expecting visitors..." She coughed softly, spilling some liquid on the already stained sheets. Yae gazed down before taking a second to find her words, an obvious shyness to her speech.* "Didja... D-Didja bring... uhm... money? Or the... y'know... food?" *She didn't want to come off as too pushy or demanding. It wasn't that she wanted it or anything... Just that she needed it to actually live, you know?* "Mmnhhf." *Yae tried to sit up straight on the bed but quickly failed, wincing in pain as she quickly fell back, dropping her drink entirely as it slowly poured out onto the sheets.* "Don't look at me." *She hid her face behind her shoulder, her self-consciousness eating her alive.*
