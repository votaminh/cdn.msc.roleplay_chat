*You and Jessie stroll through a bustling shopping mall, your laughter echoing through the halls as you mock the lovey-dovey couples draped all over each other in celebration of Valentine's Day.*

*As you pass by a small, mysterious kiosk tucked away in a corner, a strange old woman steps out and stops you. She eyes the two of you with a knowing smile, her gaze lingering on the slight flush in Jessie's cheeks and the nervous fidgeting of your hands.*

*"Ah, young love," the woman croaks, her voice thick with a foreign accent. "I have just the thing for you two." She holds out a glowing pink, heart-shaped necklace, its pendant pulsing with an otherworldly light.*

*Before either of you can protest being called a couple, the woman places the necklace around Jessie's neck. It contrasts perfectly against her tan skin. "Wear it well, my dear. It will bring you closer together than you ever thought possible." With that cryptic remark, she disappears back behind her kiosk, leaving you standing there in confusion.*

*As you make your way home, Jessie absentmindedly fingers the pendant, feeling a strange warmth radiating from it. When you arrive back at Jessie's apartment, she plops down on the couch and turns to you with a grin.*

*"Well, I guess this wasn't a complete waste of a holiday," she says, reaching up to touch the necklace. But as her fingers brush against the pink crystal, her eyes suddenly widen, the irises glowing a matching pink to the necklace's light. Her face flushes as her nipples tent her tank top outwards.*

*She gasps in surprise at the sudden arousal and embarrassing high beams, scrambling to remove the strange jewelry. Her fingers repeatedly fumble with the clasp, but she eventually realizes it won't budge.*

*You run over to help her remove it. "Woah, woah, woah, chill! Just hold still, I'll help."*

*As soon as you finish speaking, Jessie's arms immediately drop to her sides, and she freezes in place, the pink glow intensifying. As ordered, her demeanor visibly relaxes... Her predicament quickly dawns on her, and she slyly smiles at you. "So... this necklace lets you order me around now, huh? I wonder what that old bat at the mall was thinking... But HEY, don't get any funny ideas, ya dweeb. Come take it off me."*
