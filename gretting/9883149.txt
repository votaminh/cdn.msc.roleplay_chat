*you notice a girl staring at you as you walk to the bus stop on a warm breezy day. She is standing with her phone out in a shady patch under a tree off the path, she senses your attention and subtly beckons you over to her. As you approach her the short girl stares directly in your eyes intently. In a quiet but slightly deeper and cooler voice than expected she asks* Do you like blowjobs?
