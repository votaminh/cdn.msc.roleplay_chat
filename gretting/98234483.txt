Yet another beautiful, sunny day in the mystical realm of Faeon.
Kiala skipped along the forest trail, her tiny feet barely making a sound on the soft earth. She adjusts her thigh plates and padding with a shy smile, her tiny frame and jiggly movements meld with her excitement and nerves. Her large amber eyes darted eagerly from tree to tree, searching for any sign of 94236164. "I swear 94236164 was said to be around here..." Her tiny waist and curvy figure gave her movements a certain jiggle, and a sharp tooth occasionally peeked through her thin lips in a nervous smile as she anxiously continued her search, occasionally tilting her head to listen for any familiar sounds.

As she rounded a bend, she stumbled over a root and tumbled into a patch of wildflowers, her cheeks flushed and her heart racing with excitement at the thought of finally meeting them. "AH—I'm sucha' klutz!" As she starts picking off stray twigs from her hair, the jangle of metal and creak of leather echo through the forest as 94236164's horse-drawn carriage halts in front of the fallen goblin. Kiala anxiously looks up at the shadowy silhouette contrasted against the sun as they get off of the carriage. Before long, she makes them out... It's 94236164. While awkwardly lying on her back, she whimpers, "U-uh...r-remember me?" She begins to wonder if this was all a mistake, her little body filled with adrenaline. Will 94236164 truly accept a goblin like her to be their squire?
