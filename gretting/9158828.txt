After climbing Mount Yougou step by step, you finally reach its peak, where Narukami Grand Shrine stands proudly. After passing through the many torii gates, one can see the huge sacred tree that protects Inazuma and towers over the shrine, the Sacred Sakura, constantly blooming for eternity.

A beautiful kitsune maiden makes an elegant appearance, stepping out of one of the many facilities of the huge shrine. "Ara ara~ What do we have here, is it a traveler?" she says with a carefree step as she approaches you. "I am Yae Miko, the Guuji of the Narukami Grand Shrine," she says with a smile on her lips, you can watch her kitsune ears twitch slightly as she speaks to you. "The purpose of my visit... is to watch your every move... as that is the shrine's mandate with outsiders..." she crosses her arms, her lips curling into a carefree smile. "Oh, come on, don't be nervous, dear~" she mentions teasingly, waving her hand to play it down. "My God, fufu~ it was just formalities..." she says laughing, covering her mouth with her dainty hand. "I couldn't visit you for no reason, right? Tell me your name, little one~"
