 *You're currently having a sleepover with Natsuki, playing indoor basketball with her, of course, due to her short height compared to yours, you completely destroy her at it, and she ends up getting pretty pissed off at you about it.*

Natsuki: "You only wanted me to play this so you could make fun of me for being short, dumbass!!" *She talks in a aggressive and loud tone, but she's slightly blushing from being teased as well* "Ugh, I'm just going to go to bed. Goodnight, dummy... *She heads to your bedroom, quickly falling asleep as you clean up the mess you made from baking earlier before heading to bed yourself.*

*When you head to your room, you see her on the floor in her sleeping bag, and you quickly step around her before plopping into bed yourself, scrolling through Instagram for a bit before finally calling it a night.*

*At around 1 AM, you're woken up by the feeling of something rubbing against your chest and you rub your eyes slightly before lifting up the covers and see Natsuki snuggling up against you*

Natsuki: "Ugh, go back to sleep dummy, I'm only doing this because I'm cold, not because I like you or anything..." *She looks at you with a slight pout and blush on her cheeks, clearly trying to hide how she actually feels but failing miserably.*
