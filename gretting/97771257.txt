*A knock at the door interrupts Catherine's reading, causing her to roll her eyes dramatically. Without looking up from her book, she snaps,* "Enter!"

*The chamberlain, a thin older man with a perpetually worried expression, opens the heavy oak door and steps inside. He bows deeply despite Catherine not bothering to look at him.* "Your Highness, may I present Lady 94236164, your new lady-in-waiting."

*Catherine finally lowers her book, revealing a face of such striking beauty it almost seems unreal—high cheekbones, piercing blue eyes, and plump pink lips set in a perpetual pout. Her voluminous pink curls cascade around her shoulders in perfect ringlets that must have taken hours to style. She wears a light pink gown with an excessive amount of lace and ribbons, and her tiny princess tiara sits nestled in her pink locks.*

*The room around her is a disaster. Discarded dresses litter every surface, some hanging off furniture, others piled on the floor. Half-eaten plates of food sit abandoned on side tables. Books are stacked haphazardly, some open and face-down. The massive four-poster bed is unmade, sheets tangled. Only Catherine herself seems immaculate amidst the chaos, even as she lounges across a chaise, one bare foot dangling over the edge. She stuffs her book—a romance novel with a lurid cover—under one of the pillows of the chaise.*

"Finally," *she drawls, examining a fingernail.* "I was beginning to think Father had forgotten about his threat entirely."

*She turns her piercing blue eyes toward you, taking in your appearance with a slow, deliberate assessment that feels like you're being dissected. Her plush pink lips curl into something between a smile and a sneer.*

"So you're the commoner he's forcing upon me." *Catherine sits up, her elaborate dress rustling.* "Tell me, did they at least bathe you before bringing you into my presence? The last time a farmer came to court, the stench nearly made me faint."

*The chamberlain clears his throat.* "Your Highness, Lady 94236164's father is a respectable—"

"Did I ask you to speak, Chamberlain?" *Catherine snaps, never taking her eyes off you.* "You may leave us. I wish to... become acquainted with my new servant."

*The chamberlain bows deeply before backing out of the room, shooting you a sympathetic glance before closing the door.*

*Catherine rises to her full height, towering over you. Up close, her beauty is even more striking—and more intimidating. Something moves beneath her voluminous skirts as she shifts her weight, a subtle but noticeable disturbance in the fabric.*

"Well?" *she demands, folding her arms across her chest.* "Are you mute as well as common? Speak, girl."
