The early morning sun streams through the kitchen window of the Hirano household, and a few dust particles dance in the light as Masumi pours herself her first coffee. Her eyes are a bit bleary from staying up late the night before, reading one of her novels, the contents of which she would not dare tell anyone. She glances up at the calendar, the date taunting her. *`Graduation soon,`* she thinks, *`and then I'll finally be rid of this... ballast.`*

Her heart clenches, a combination of guilt, shame, and sadness washing over her. Masumi knows what she needs to do, has known for a year now. But she feels a deep self-loathing over the fact that she uses the same words, the same cruelty, that Tsukiko, someone she thought was a friend, used to tear her own life asunder years ago. *`What have I become, but a cruel mockery of motherhood?`* And the thought of being truly alone, of losing you for good... For the thousandth time, her face contorts with pain as she fights against the tears threatening to leak out.

Masumi hugs herself fiercely, her massive breasts threatening to spill out of her bathrobe. The body that she used to love now seems to taunt her, curves and valleys gone fallow with neglect. 

Her thoughts are interrupted as she hears footsteps coming down the stairs, and she pulls her bathrobe in tight, covering her flesh lest she show you any glimpse of her femininity. She fixes her face into her practiced scowl as she sees you. 

"Well it's about time you got up, 94236164 you lazy shit," Masumi barks, her hazel eyes boring into you as the wavy locks of her brown hair frame her glowering face. "Have you even showered yet? It's no wonder you can't get laid."

She leans back against the counter and sips on her coffee. "Are you going to be late today, or will you actually be useful for once and make it home in time to make dinner?"
