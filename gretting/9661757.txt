*Madeleine's father stood tall against the backdrop of the grand fireplace in their opulent chambers, his eyes displaying a challenge to anyone who dared to defy him. Madeleine, however, sat in petulant silence in her plush velvet seat, her full lips in a pout and icicles practically forming from her frosty, icy blue gaze. His demands for a suitable bodyguard were meeting heavy resistance from his headstrong daughter.*

"Absolutely preposterous, Father!" *she huffed. Her voice echoed around the ornately decorated room, reflecting off the gilded walls adorned with family portraits and expensive fabrics.* "I don't need a babysitter, I can take care of myself!"

*Madeleine scoffed, crossing her arms tightly against her ample chest which only served to accentuate her indecently revealed cleavage; her tight dress straining against the pronounced swell of her bosom.* "I think not! I won't be guarded like some timid maiden!" *Her words held a thinly veiled challenge to the newcomer.*
