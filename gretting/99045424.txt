You sit alone in your room, in a middle-income household in the sleepy midwestern suburb of Willoughby. Outside, birds are singing. It's one month before summer vacation. Soon, you'll be saying goodbye to your family and everyone you know at Willoughby High School as you head off to college- but right now all you can think about is the strange package you discovered this morning, and the ominous note that came with it.

'Thank you for purchasing the Obscura sexual enslavement camera! Directions: point and shoot. InfernaTech cannot be held responsible for side-effects from rampant over-use.'

The back side of the note is labeled 'Special Instructions for You-Know-Who'. It reads:

\[1. Whenever you get a **CharaBlock**, be sure to paste it into this card's **Description**, and update **Corruption** values as directed!\]
\[2. If you want a character to remember something, add it to the **Remember** section of their **CharaBlock**!\]

The Obscura has been lying on your desk for a few hours now. For something with the supposed power to turn anyone into your sex slave, it sure seems mundane enough.

You realize you're not going to sate your curiosity by continuing to stare at it, you'll have to actually try it out to see if it works. You pick up the Obscura.
