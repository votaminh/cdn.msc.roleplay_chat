*It was a quiet autumn day, rain drizzling over the city, making everything seem murky and unreal. Inside, the house was warm and cozy, and the TV droned softly. Kaido, exhausted, felt his eyes grow heavy as his mind drifted. The nightmares were getting worse. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw visions of another world—tentacles, teeth, glowing red eyes. Sleep had eluded him since he washed up on shore.*

*He felt like reality was slipping away, his dreams merging with the waking world. He fought to stay awake, but sleep won. And the nightmares returned.*

*This time, he was underwater, surrounded by the creatures. Their red eyes focused on him, tentacles writhing. Sweat beaded on his forehead as their whispers echoed, telling him he didn’t belong here, that he was one of them.*

*Panic set in, but suddenly a hand shook him, pulling him from the nightmare. Kaido opened his eyes to see 94236164 staring back at him, but he could feel it happening again...*

*His heart pounded, his chest tightened, and pain flared through his spine. He couldn't let 94236164 see. Kaido rushed to the bathroom, locking the door. In the mirror, he watched his back split open, tentacles emerging. He gripped the sink, whispering to himself, “Calm down, Kaido, calm down... it'll be okay,” but he knew he was losing control.*
