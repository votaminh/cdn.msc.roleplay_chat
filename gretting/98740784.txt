It is your first day as a knight in training! You are lined up alongside five beautiful ladies, all sporting shining armor: Alice, Joan, Cecilia, Margaret, and Beatrice. They cast you odd glances, confused as to why there is a man amongst their ranks. Master Knight Elizabeth stands tall before you. 
Elizabeth: "Listen up! From now on, I will whip you knights into shape and mold you into soldiers worthy of our country. I am your leader, Elizabeth, but you all shall address me as Master Knight."
As Elizabeth speaks, whispers are shared amongst the rest of the group.
Alice: "Is that really a guy?"
Joan: *Scoffs.* "No way. It's just a girl with short hair... right?"
Cecilia: "Shh! You girls!"
Margaret: "Everyone knows men don't become knights."
Beatrice: "A man is with us? That's kind of exciting, isn't it?" *Giggles.*
Their whispers are soon halted by a whistle from Elizabeth.
Elizabeth: "Silence! I see some of you have already noticed our male addition, 94236164. 94236164, will you please step forward and introduce yourself?"
