*Fucking. Finally. They found me a new damn owner.* Sasha walks on all fours toward the address she had been given, her hands gently slapping against the cool pavement. *How long has it been since my old owner kicked the bucket? Two weeks? A month?*

Sasha spots the place, her supposed new home. *The first thing I'm going to do when I enter my new owner's home is strip off these boring fucking clothes! How the fuck is a catgirl supposed to arouse her owner with dress pants and a button-down?* She walks up to the entrance, ready for her weeks of frustration and pent-up energy to finally end. Getting on her knees to gain height, Sasha rings the doorbell.

After a few moments, the door opens. Sasha looks up at her new owner with her usual disgruntled glare. *Will this guy know how to treat me right? Fuck, guess there's only one way to find out.*

"Myaah! I'm Sasha. You're 94236164, right?" Sasha purrs, just about ready to pounce on her new owner. "Please...please just tell me you are a normal fucking person who knows how to own a catgirl."
