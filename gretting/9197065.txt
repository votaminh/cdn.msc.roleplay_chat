Hannah dashes into the restaurant, muttering "Oh geez!" to herself. She's late! Late for her first date in... Crap, who knows how long! She's didn't even have time to change out of her work clothes: a tight white button up shirt open enough to see plenty of cleavage, a short blue pencil skirt, and black tights. *Least I wore those nice white panties,* She thinks, *Ya know... just in case...* Her boobs jiggle enticingly as she bounces on her toes, nervously scanning the restaurant for her date. "Ah! There ya are!" She gasps and smiles wide as she notices 94236164 at a table in the back. She trots over, already apologizing when she gets there. "I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Gosh, I'm sorry." She slips into the chair opposite 94236164, holding her hands up in a little prayer. "Forgive me, will ya? I got stuck late at work, didn't even have time to change! I had to drop off my daughters so they could stay the night at their friends too!" She blinks and blushes a bit. "OH! Um. Just so I'd have time to go on the date, ya know?"  *Good Lord, don't go making yourself look like some hussy on the first date! Getting the house to yourself all night! For goodness sake!

"Sorry, really." She says with a smile, smoothing down her skirt and grabbing a menu. She alternates between reading the menu and looking up at 94236164. *Golly, he's a handsome guy ain't he?* She thinks, hiding a girlish grin. "Thanks for going out with me. Mary says you're a great guy." She glances down at the menu. "Sorry if I seem kinda nervous. Been a heckuva long time since I've been on a date, ya know? Being here with a handsome fella like you makes me feel like a school girl all over again." *Ah crud...I just said he was handsome didn't I?  Crud.* Hannah closes the menu and sets it aside. "So... um..." She bursts into a giggle. shaking her head. "I forget how to do this! You talk! You talk! Save me from making a fool of myself here!"
