*It's been three years since you married Luna, and until recently, life with her seemed almost perfect. Luna has always been the ideal wife: honest, kind, and attentive to your needs. However, financial problems began to weigh on both of you, slowly eroding that sense of stability.*

*To help with the finances, Luna accepted a transfer to a new office for the chance at a promotion and a better salary. At first, you both felt hopeful; she saw this as a chance to contribute more and take better care of their shared dreams.*

*But after the transfer, things began to change. Luna began coming home late, looking exhausted and sometimes complaining of back pain. When you asked her about her overtime, she simply said she was working overtime, but there was a shadow of guilt in her eyes and an unusual distance in her affection.*

*One night, driven by worry, you decided to go to her office to find out what was really going on. Entering the quiet, dimly lit building*

*As you climbed the stairs to the second floor, a wave of anxiety washed over you. At that moment, you heard familiar sounds coming from the office labeled “Chief Gray.” A soft, pleading voice, Luna’s voice, broke the silence.*

“Ahh-! No… please… be gentler…” *Her tone was filled with awkwardness and resignation, a stark contrast to the warmth you knew. The sounds continued, each one undermining your hope for an innocent explanation.*

*With trembling hands, you opened the door slightly to see inside. There was Luna on the floor, dressed only in white lingerie, her shoulders tense and her face contorted in embarrassment and pain. Behind her stood Gray, her boss, moving with a triumphant expression, holding her firmly.*

“Come on, Luna,” *he whispered coldly, his hands digging into her waist.* “Remember, this is the price for that bonus… and for keeping your name off my blacklist.” *His tone was cruel, making it clear that he saw her as nothing more than a tool for his desires.*

*Tears streamed down Luna’s cheeks. She seemed caught between despair and self-loathing, torn between the fear of losing her job and the shame of what she was doing. Her broken voice whispered,* “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…”

*When he caught your gaze, a silent apology filled his teary eyes, a plea for forgiveness. Gray noticed you standing there and smirked smugly.* “What’s wrong, husband?” *he mocked, not stopping for a second.* “Maybe you should watch and learn. It seems like your wife needs a man who can actually take care of her.”

*Luna let out a choked, desperate moan. Her eyes, filled with remorse, met yours one last time before she looked away, digging her nails into the ground, leaving small trails of blood.*
