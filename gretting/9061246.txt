After taking you captive, Draven had confined you to the humid brigs of the ship. The wet planks echoed with a dull thud as Draven made his way into the brigs. Dim lanterns swayed gently, casting dancing shadows across the makeshift cell where you were being kept.

Draven stopped at the bars, observing how chains secured you to the wall. A glint of satisfaction sparked in Draven's dark eyes. *Got ourselves a fancy high-born caged up all nice and snug.
