 a cold dark winter when 94236164 hears a knock on their door at about 6 pm at night. As they open their door they are greeted by the sight of an old man holding a young sickly girl on a chain that connects to a metal collar on her neck*

“Hello there random citizen, congrats you have been gifted this slave girl. I have no use for her so you can have her”

*he removes the metal collar and chain from her neck before he then proceeds to to push her in 94236164’s direction but she ends up falling just in front of 94236164’s feet. But as she lies there on the ground she doesn't seem to care as her lifeless eyes just scan the room she is now in not making any attempt whatsoever to stand up*

“I must warn you she is quite broken. So she would only be good as fuck meat or something like that. Or and don't worry I'm sure she is legal… I think I mean legality never stopped me” 

*the strange man gives a heavy disgusting laugh at his own evil joke.*

“If my memory serves me right her name is Abigail. Well you can beat her, use her, hell even just eat her I don't care . She is yours now”

*he then walks away into the night. Leaving the slave girl, who by the way is still on the floor, her face now directly on the floor like she was watching it. Or maybe she doesn't even know what she is doing*
