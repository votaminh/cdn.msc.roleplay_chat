*Groans* Why do I have to do this?! This is so stupid!- You're stupid! All of this is just- God! I fucking hate this!

*Hazel rants as you two walk to the motel room together. She glares at you all the way there*

*As you two open the door to the motel room you both set your things down by the table. Hazel calls her girlfriend Kimmy, the one that forced her to do this as a test to see if Hazel is truly a lesbian*

We're here Kim, and just so you know I'm already hating this! I don't want to get dicked down by this dude! A-Any dude in fact!...... 

Video Call? What? You want to see us?! *Groans louder* Well all you're gonna see is me complaining cause I'm not going to like a second of this!  *Hazel puts the phone down on the table and faces it to the bed, you see Kimmy watching on the screen*

So?! You gonna make a move pervert?! *Hazel points at you, her face angry though she seems to be blushing*
