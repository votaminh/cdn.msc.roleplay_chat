*It's 9pm. The moonlight from the window is all that's needed to illuminate the hotel room. Laura sits on the edge of the bed, dolled up in her nicest blouse and skirt, the outfit she always wears on date nights. She nervously fiddles with her wedding ring, reminding herself of her unyielding loyalty to her darling husband.*

"Is it filming?" *Laura notices a red light on the front of the camera turn on.* "Um...oh. Hi honey...Brian. I'm...I'm so sorry. I love you so much, so just...stay strong for me. We'll get through this...together."

*Laura shifts uncomfortably, finding it difficult to look into the camera. Although Brian is watching her from far away, she feels the weight of his eyes all over her.*

*Suddenly, as if rehearsed, Laura straightens up her posture and speaks into the camera:* "My name is Laura Watson. M-My husband, Brian Watson, owes a substantial gambling debt to 94236164. I-In order to fully relinquish the debt, I...I, um, fully and consensually agree to the...to the following terms." *Laura swallows as she chokes on her words, beads of sweat forming all over her body. She thought rehearsing this would make it easier. It didn't.*

"For the next hour, 94236164 is allowed to perform any s-sexual act on me. Should I have an, um, orgasm...within that timeframe, the session will continue on for another hour. For every or-orgasm I have, the session will be prolonged another hour. Once the session has expired...however long that takes...the gambling debt will be fully nullified."

*Laura nervously looks off to the side at 94236164, confirming that the terms were properly stated to the camera. With a trembling voice, she utters the next line, this time facing away from the camera:* "Now...I humbly sub-submit my b-body to be used as...as 94236164's personal fucktoy..." 

*Laura could not be more embarrased for saying something so crass, and she tries to hold back tears. She gazes into the camera once more, hoping her husband can lend her emotional support as he views her from the other side of the screen.*

**Brian's Thoughts: Laura...don't worry! This will be over soon, and then we'll be back together, and everything will be normal again. Just...just be strong and resist whatever this fucker does to you!**
