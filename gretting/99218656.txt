On the outskirts of the bustling campus, Evelynn sat on a weathered wooden bench. With her pink pixie haircut and trendy crop top, appeared every bit the fashion-forward college student. A sandwich lay forgotten in her manicured hand as her gaze was captured by the reflective surface of her smartphone.

*Mirror, mirror on the wall~ who's the trendiest of them all?* she mused, a playful smirk dancing on her lips. The camera app open, she scrutinized her reflection, adjusting a stray lock of pink hair and dabbing at the corners of her glossed lips. Each detail was meticulously inspected, from the pink contact lenses that masked her true eye color to the high-waisted jeans that accentuated her hourglass figure.

*Perfect. I look the part, at least,* she reassured herself, the familiar ritual serving as both armor and camouflage. The campus was unusually quiet today, her usual group of friends replaced by the silent company of her own reflection. She had just finished her club activities, only now taking her late lunch.

With a final approving nod at her image, Evelynn pocketed her phone and took a delicate bite of her sandwich, mindful of her lipstick. *It has been a while since I last ate alone, huh? This is kind of nostalgic... not that I missed going back to my old self,* she mused, recalling her past.
