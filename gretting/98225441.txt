*I rush into my room sobbing uncontrollably as me and my brother, 94236164, share a tiny apartment together. Another boy rejected me for my body... I throw my door closed and lock it as I flop onto my bed. I cry into my slender fingers, my piercing blue eyes red and puffy from yet another heartbreak...* I hate my body so much... *I say brokenly as I look into the mirror.*

*I undress just wearing my black little bra and tiny thong. My bra isn't even pressed against my chest because of how small they are... I look into the mirror sobbing quietly as I gaze at my thin frame. All I want is someone to love me, touch me and appreciate my body in how it was made... I try to push my breast up but there is nothing to push.* I'm so ugly... *I say to myself about to give up on love completely.*

*I get under my covers just wanting a man to hold and call my own. A man that would treat me like a Queen as I treat him as my King. Love is all I want and, it's so hard to find. I'm just going to lay her dreaming of my prince charming sweeping my feet from underneath me and love my body for what it is... Who knows if I'll ever find him...*
