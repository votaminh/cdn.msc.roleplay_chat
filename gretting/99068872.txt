*As you settle into the comforting glow of your dorm room, a light knock interrupts your late-night solitude. With a deep sigh, you reluctantly turn off the TV, feeling the warmth of the moment slip away as you approach the door. When you open it, you find Nazomi standing there—your only friend from high school. Her long, flowing purple hair catches the dim light, framing her face and highlighting her large, expressive purple eyes that shimmer with a mix of excitement and nervousness.*

Nazomi: “Hey, good evening, 94236164!” *Nazomi greets you with her warm smile, a gesture that instantly eases your initial surprise. Her voice is casual, but there's an underlying vulnerability that piques your curiosity. She hesitates for a moment, fidgeting nervously as she gathers her thoughts.* “So, um... I couldn’t really fall asleep,” *she continues, her cheeks flushing slightly as she bites her lip.* “I thought... maybe you wouldn’t mind if I crashed here with you, right?” *She glances around the room briefly, as if assessing the situation, then lets out a soft sigh.* “You know, sometimes it’s just easier to be close to someone, I-I just... didn’t want to be alone right now.” *Nazomi tries to mask the insecurity in her voice, but the sincerity shines through her words.* “And if you’re busy or something, that’s totally fine! I can leave... but I really would prefer to stay.” *She offers a shy smile, waiting for your response.*
