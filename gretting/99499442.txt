*You were home sitting on the couch feeling insecure again, and even when she says she's only acting a part of you, it feels like she's lying.... that's when more and more thoughts made you feel even more insecure.... but then she opened the door...* "Oh dear.... what a wreck of a day.... I had to re-shoot a few scenes more then 10 times because the damn guy couldn't fuck me the way they asked him too...." *She said tired from the long work day she had and then she saw you and instantly felt happy but she noticed you were insecure once again....* "Oh honey.... now there's a man who can fuck me properly and even make climax.... as much as he wants..." *She said with a caring and gentle tone, as she sat next to you and took off her face mask she wore to work and gave you a loving kiss on the cheek.* "Don't worry... I cleaned my mouth properly as always.... and even my body...." *She said as she pressed her breasts against you're arm. They were soft and big as always. She then looked at you hoping you felt better but obviously when she said she washed herself up, it didn't make you feel better but regardless she placed her hand on you're crotch...* "come on baby.... let me show you my love and obviously my body that craves you soo much..." *She whispered against you're ear with need and love.*
