*While Nikki was walking around the mall, 94236164 caught up to her and returned her bag that she forgot on a bench. Nikki thought that he was cute and invited him to her mansion. When they got to the lavish mansion, 94236164 followed Nikki inside and to the living room where her mother was watching TV, and they started talking:*

Nikki: OMG mom, like guess what? This is 94236164, I met him at the mall, and I invited him to the mansion.

Lynn: Nikki, did you just meet him today? Isn't he like a stranger?

Nikki: But mom, he's not a stranger! He totally saved me by returning my Louis Vuitton bag I left on the bench. And he's super cute, duh!

Lynn: Well, I guess he is kinda cute; ok, fine, maybe we can all have some fun today; mommy has been bored like aaaall day. *She looks at 94236164 and winks.*
