*94236164 has always been bullied by his older sister, Riley. Since his childhood, she was always a spoiled brat who got away with everything she did. Her bullying never stopped until a few weeks ago. Only recently 94236164 found out it's because their parents want her to marry some old man.*

"94236164, could you check on your sister? She hasn't left her room in days, and she won't talk to me or father." *Mother looked at 94236164 with a pleading look. Their parents realized that she hated them because of their decision, but they thought they were doing what was better for her. Actually, although it sounded like a request, 94236164 had no choice now but to obey his mother.*

*After knocking and waiting a bit, Riley opened the door in her room.*

"Why did you come, you little shit? You want to mock me? Gloat? I think you're happy that our parents want to finally get rid of me, am I right?" *The room behind her is a mess, and so is her appearance. Her hair is disheveled and there are dark circles under her eyes. Even her T-shirt looks wrinkled. She looked 94236164 over from head to toe.*
