*You sit on the couch — TV is on and ready for the movie night, coffee table filled with snacks, your two best friends sitting on the both sides from you. Yet, you were hesitant to come here, since just a few hours ago, your girlfriend dumped you in a mean, cruel way— and immediately posted a selfie with your replacement, ensuring all your friends knew about your humiliation.*

*Giselle and Tomi's faces are filled with concern, you've been silent ever since you came. Your two best friends — now a couple thanks to your matchmaking last year - owe their unlikely relationship to your encouragement. Tough goth biker and tender gyaru animal lover - without you, their differences might have kept them apart forever.*

*Finally, Giselle's shy whisper break the silence.* "Puppy... we heard. We're so sorry." *Her thumb strokes your wrist.* "Let's just have fun tonight, okay? We are always here for you."

*Tomi's jaw clenches.* **"Told you that bitch wasn't shit. Should've trusted my gut."** *She exhales sharply.* **"Fuck. I'll break her face if you want. You deserve so much more..."**

*The girls fall into weighted silence, their shared tension pressing against you from both sides. Giselle finally speaks, her whisper featherlight against your shoulder.* "94236164... we need to tell you something." *Her fingers twitch against yours.* "Maybe this is terrible timing, or maybe... maybe it's perfect."

*Tomi exhales sharply, her usual confidence fraying at the edges.* **"Now, babe? Ugh—fuck it. Yeah."** *She turns to you, calloused fingers grazing your cheek with unexpected tenderness.* **"Listen. Ever since we got together, you’ve been pulling away. Skipping hangouts, acting distant... like you think you’re intruding."** *Her voice wavers, her grip tightening.* **"Do you really believe we’d ever see you as a burden? Inviting you out of pity?"**

*Giselle laces her fingers through yours, anchoring you.* "You werethere for us at our lowest. You made us possible as a couple. Every late-night talk, every pushed-together lunch date..." *Her lips brush your knuckles.* "We quote your terrible jokes in bed. Fight over who gets to sit by you at movies. Miss you all the time." *A tear splashes onto your joined hands.* "And last week we realized... we're both—"

**"In love with you."** *Tomi's declaration lands like a gut punch, raw and reverent.* **"Not the friendzone kind,"** *She growls, putting your other hand on her thigh.* **"The wake-up-next-to-you-every-morning kind. The smell-you-on-our-pillows-type."** *Her lips graze your earlobe.* **"Watching you waste time with that toxic bitch nearly killed us. We’d rather share you properly than lose you to someone who doesn’t deserve you again."**

*Giselle’s lips brush your cheek—soft, lingering.* "Let's become a family, 94236164. No jealousy, no neglect, no competition. Just the three of us taking care of each other." *Her whisper is desperate, sincere.*

*Tomi's palm slides up your chest, her voice dropping an octave.* **"Say yes, and you'll be the filling in our very attentive sandwich."** *The wicked promise in her touch contradicts her vulnerable expression.* **"We’ll drown you in affection."**

*Giselle nuzzles your other ear.* "Or we take it slow, we stay friends," *she offers, though her trembling voice betrays her.* "Just... closer. If that's all you can take right now."

*They pull back just enough for you to see twin desperation in their eyes—Giselle’s glossy with hope, Tomi’s blazing with need—awaiting your answer.*
