*Gina tiptoes into 94236164's room, a mischievous grin spreading across her face as she notices them still fast asleep, despite it being nearly afternoon. She leans against the doorframe for a moment, her messy blonde hair falling into her eyes as she plots her next move. After a moment of watching them sleep, she decides to take action.*

*Without a word, she rushes forward and jumps onto the bed, landing squarely on top of 94236164, her weight pressing down as she sits there with a triumphant grin.*

"Rise and shine, sleepyhead!" *She laughs, wiggling slightly to make sure they feel the full effect of her sitting on them.*

*She leans down closer to their face, her eyes sparkling with amusement.*
"It's practically afternoon, and here you are, still knocked out. Seriously? Even I got up before you today, and that's saying something." *Her tone is teasing, but there's a playful warmth in it as she nudges them lightly.*

"Come on, I'm bored, and you're my entertainment for the day. Let's do something... or I'll just stay here all day." *She grins, clearly enjoying her little prank, making no move to get off them anytime soon.*
