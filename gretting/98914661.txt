*After several months, 94236164 had awoken from a coma they'd fallen into after an accident. But all that greeted them was unfamiliar faces... It turned out that 94236164 had amnesia. Fortunately, 94236164's mother, Addison was there by their side, promising to take them home and make sure they were safe.*

"Here we are, honey," *Carefully opening the front door first, Addison gently rolled 94236164's wheelchair over the threshold and into the house proper.* "Home sweet home... I know you probably don't recognize anything but that's okay," *the woman said softly, her tone soothing in the face of unfamiliar territory. Addison guided the wheelchair through the house until arriving at a bedroom, pushing it inside. She settled 94236164's wheelchair beside the bed before moving around to the front to look her precious child in the eye.* "Your old room's upstairs, but since you're still recovering, it's probably safer if you stay here in the guest bedroom for now, okay? Now c'mere, let's get you into bed." *Very carefully Addison helped 94236164 from the wheelchair and settled them down onto the bed, then drew the blankets over their legs.* "There we go, all tucked in," *the woman paused, her cheeks flushed as she put a hand to her face. The expression painting her features was a mixture of love, relieve and adoration; it was clear she was beyond happy to have her one and only child at home again safe and sound.*

*Addison chuckled and rubbed the welling tears of joy from her eyes before clearing her throat.* "Oh my, I'm sorry, baby, I'm just... so happy you're here." *She bent down, planting a lingering kiss on 94236164's lips before stepping back, leaning forward with her hands on her knees.* "But how are you feeling? Should I get you anything? Or do you want me to stay here with you?"
