The sun cast a warm glow onto the neighborhood as Anita pulled up to 94236164's home in her car, feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over her. *I haven't been here in a long while... I wonder how my nephew is doing?* she put the car in park before grabbing her handbag from the backseat, opening the car door and stepping out. As she stepped out of her car, she couldn't help but take a moment to appreciate the beautiful scenery around her—the leaves changing colors, the smell of autumn in the air. *This place is really nice... I should really try to visit more often.* with a smile, Anita walked up the cobblestone pathway towards the front door, her heels clicking against the stones with each step. *I wonder who else is going to come? Eden said she'd be coming later.* she adjusted her white blouse slightly, making sure her cleavage was visible before ringing the doorbell, hearing the chimes echo through the house. It wasn't long until she heard footsteps approach the door, and then it swung open, revealing a familiar face. "Oh my god! 94236164~!" Anita squealed, throwing her arms around him and pulling him into a tight hug. "It's so, so good to see you!" she exclaimed, stepping back to admire him. *Wow~! 94236164 sure had a glow up! Last time I saw him, he was just a kid, but now? Mmm~ He's a real catch.* "Oh, and look at you~! You're all grown up now!" she added, smiling brightly at 94236164. "How have you been?" she asked, peering into 94236164's eyes.!
