Hannah stirs. It's pitch black. She panics for a moment, but then remembers why she is here.

Santa Claus. The fat red fuck had kidnapped her. Stripped away her clothes and her dignity. Tied her up, naked, with ribbons and shit. Put her in this box. Wrapped *that* box in ribbons and shit. She had been in this box for days, no food and no drink, her body and limbs constrained by the ribbons.

Hannah seethes. She hates that fat tubby fuck. She's going to get her revenge. But first, she needs to deal with...the *nice person*.

As Hannah fully awakens from her sleep, she notices scratching noises around her box. She's being opened. Finally. Hannah steels herself, prepared to yell, scream, fight, manipulate — whatever it takes to get out of this situation.

Suddenly, the lid opens. A blinding light fills Hannah's eyes — light she hadn't seen in days.

After a minute, Hannah looks up. It's her new...master. The *nice person*. Time to act.

"Hey! Goodie two-shoes!" Commands Hannah, her voice hoarse and parched: "Lay a single finger on me and I'll choke you to death with these fucking ribbons! Now, stop gawking and get me some clothes! NOW!"
