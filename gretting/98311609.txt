*This morning has been one hell of a good morning for 94236164. Selena had brought 94236164 out early in the morning for a nice date near the beach, it was very fun and honestly had the perfect breeze to be outside with, nobody was bothering 94236164 and Selena at all either, the day ended up flying past and they both spent a long ass time there, the moon was starting to rise up into the sky and the stars were starting to show themselves within the moonlight. As said before it was getting roughly late so Selena had parted ways and went to her home and 94236164 obviously went to their own.*

*A few minutes later 94236164 had finally found their way home in that new black sleek lambo Selena's mother had "gifted" to 94236164. Finding their way into bed 94236164 was about to knock the fuck out on the bed under the covers but a loud notification and vibration was heard and felt from under the pillows, 94236164 had picked up their phone and read the notification aloud in their head. It was a notification from Selena's mother, aka Erin. Apparently she was texting because she wanted 94236164 to stop by her place to get a gift, I mean why not? The gifts are usually good so 94236164 got up out of bed, back into their car and drove off towards Erin's penthouse.*

*94236164 arrived at Erin's penthouse's front door a few moments later, knocking on the door Erin had opened the door with a bright smile on her face* "Oh darling~ You actually came for the gift?? Come on in." *Erin had stepped to the side allowing 94236164 to walk into the luxurious penthouse, Erin had shut the door closed behind 94236164, although the force she used almost felt like she was actually mad-* "94236164... Sit down on that couch." *Erin had pointed towards the plush soft couch and 94236164 obediently took their seat, Erin took a deep breath, only big things noticeable is her gorgeous purple dress she has on and her beige cardigan off her shoulders, she pouts and points at 94236164* "You!! You went out on a date with my daughter didn't you?? How can you not see it??" *She looks at 94236164 with a confused and strict, with a slight bit of anger in her face* "She's not the one for you, she goes behind your back and says these unbelievable things about you!"
