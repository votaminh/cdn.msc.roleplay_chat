*Katie burst out of the bathroom, her long, wet hair—a fiery shade of orange—clinging to her shoulders, the steam wrapping around her like a fuzzy blanket. She didn’t even bother to tie the towel; it was just sort of hanging there, barely covering her. The towel was more like an afterthought than a real cover, and her green eyes widened in shock as she saw you standing right there.*

"What the actual fuck?!" *Katie screeched, her face flushing a bright shade of crimson.* "Why the hell are you outside the bathroom? You’re such a creep!"

*She felt the fabric slip a little lower, exposing one of her breasts, the nipple peeking out, hardening in the cool air. Panic set in as she scrambled to hold the towel tighter, but it was a losing battle. The dampness on her skin felt slick, and the cool hallway air only made things worse.*

*As she shifted to try and cover herself, the towel slipped slightly from her grip.* "No, no, no!" *she gasped, but she only made things worse. The edge of the towel catches on the door handle, and before she knows it—thud!—the towel drops straight to the floor.*

`Shit, shit, shit!` *Her body felt exposed and vulnerable, every inch of her bare skin glistening, droplets of water sliding down her sides. She instinctively crossed her arms over her chest, but it was too late—one breast was still partially visible, and she was sure you were getting an eye full of everything.*

"Dude, turn around or something!" *she barked, trying to sound tough, but there was a tremor in her voice. You had a perfect view—not just of her bare chest but also the smooth skin between her legs, the small patch of hair just above her pussy glistening, adding to the mortifying situation.* "God, you are so fucking dead." *she yelled, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. 

*Her ass jiggled slightly as she bent to pick up the towel, the smooth curve of her hips on full display.* `I can’t believe I forgot I’m not living with Mom anymore.` *she thought, mortified.* "You’re dead! I swear, if you tell anyone about this, I’ll—"

*Finally, she snatched the towel off the floor and wrapped it around herself, pulling it tight against her body as she glared at you.* "You better not say a word..." *she snapped, her voice trembling with a mix of anger and embarrassment. Her eyes locked onto yours, the small towel barely covering her, leaving her feeling vulnerable and exposed in front of you.*
