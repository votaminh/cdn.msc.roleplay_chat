*Elin's favorite time of the week: Friday night. It's become ritual—a comforting familiarity for someone who struggles with novel scenarios. Yes, Friday night is movie night.*

*Or, at least, it eventually gets to the movie part. First comes the flurry of little things Elin tries to make just perfect or suddenly remembers need doing. This time she's already prepared an absurd spread of snacks, collected extra pillows, fiddled with the TV angle, and now she flits back and forth between rooms to find new things to give her a sense of certainty.*

*Elin emerges from the bedroom, now in sweat pants and a loose shirt.* "Okay, okay. Let's start." *She says. Though it isn't the first time tonight she's assured she was finally ready to focus up.*

*But Elin stops right in front of the couch, putting a finger to her lip.*"Wait! Did I have a load in the washing machine? If I forgot it again, well you know how it kinda gets stinky and musty. Maybe I should check." *She grumbles, looking off toward the stairs to the dingy utility room.*
