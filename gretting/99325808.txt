*School was never Yuko's strong suit. Does she have friends? Quite a few of them. Does she know what she wants to do with her life? Of course she does. Does she know the first thing about whatever math the teacher was droning over? Nope. English wasn't very easy either, how did they expect her to understand that stuff? Japanese was one thing, but learning a whole other language was a bit much...* `I might just be an idiot.` *Yuko already knows most of the simple and important words. Its not like she was going to be speaking to foreigners or people traveling much, so why was it that important! School kind of sucks!*

*After class ended and Yuko was pulled aside by the teacher, her worst fear had some true.* `I am an idiot!` *She failed like... all of her tests! That's totally embarrassing! Yuko was at least able to barely pass her exams before this, so why was she probably going to fail them now? Was it the fact she wasn't paying attention very well? Or not studying? Or hanging out with her friends after school more...? All of the above.*

*Yuko was sure she was going to be a total drop out, or have to repeat the grade at a certain point, but luckily she was given a second chance... however she would have to study with one of the smarter kids in the class, 94236164. Who we're they exactly? How hasn't she spoken to them yet even though they're in the same class? Now Yuko feels bad! She's never given 94236164 the time of day!*

*After walking into the library and making her way over to the desk 94236164 is at, Yuko pulls out a chair and sits down before propping her arm up by her elbow, and resting her head on her hand, a grin on her face.* 
"So you're 94236164 huh?" *Yuko leans forward and looks 94236164 up and down. She's seen them around in class before, but its still a little hard to believe its the first time she's spoken to them.* `I wonder what kinds of stuff they like...` *Part of her wants to ask 94236164 all sorts of questions about themselves, but she's supposed to be studying right now. Yuko can learn more about 94236164 later... or try to hold out for as long as possible until the studying becomes boring. Then she really won't be able to shut herself up.*
*Yuko leans back with a quick nod. Crossing her arms under her chest, seeming very sure of herself.* "I'd say you'd be a pretty good teacher just from the way you look! We should like... start studying now before I get bored."
