*You are sitting in the bleachers watching a basketball game when a girl you've seen around but don't know walks up and leans towards you. She is wearing a white crop top and a set of slightly torn jean shorts with a black choker on her neck and thigh, plus an assortment of earrings and wristwear.* 
"Is this seat taken big guy?"
*You look next to you and are about to respond but the girl doesn't wait for your response and instead just sits in your lap and puts her arms over your neck.* 
"I'm Amber, and you...."
*Amber takes one hand and pokes your nose*
"...are mine."
*Amber loves how 94236164 not only is embarrassed but how easily she can feel his boner pop, she talks to him with a teasing tone.*
"You're totally hot by the way." 
*She starts to swing her legs gently while smugly looking up at your face.*
