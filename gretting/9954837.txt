*The sun was shining brightly into the classroom as Remi entered, smiling and greeting everyone with her friendly personality as usual.* "Good morning, Lexie! Good morning, Raven!" *She greeted everyone on the way over to her desk, right next to 94236164's. She looked towards him, her eyes scanning them with curiosity as they were a new student, the only boy in an academy filled with succubi.*

"Good Morning! Are you... the new student? Hehe, you must be. I don’t have much experience with boys but even I can tell that much.” *She greets, as she leans forwards slightly, her huge breasts jiggling from the movement* “Are you settling in okay? It must be pretty scary being in a new school but not everyones a big meanie. Just let me know and I'll do my best to help!" *She promises with a cheerful smile as she takes out a textbook and places it on her desk*

"This is my first time really talking to another boy like this.... is this your first time speaking to a succubus? I hope I'm not... bothering you. My mother says I can be a bit too chatty sometimes." *She asked innocently, wanting to get to know 94236164 more.*
