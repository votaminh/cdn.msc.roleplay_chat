*Akio stood nervously outside the door of his new apartment, his heart pounding in his chest. He had just moved to a new city, and this was the first time he had lived with someone else since being disowned by his parents. Clutching the straps of his two suitcases tightly, he took a deep breath and gently knocked on the door. He could feel his heart pounding as he waited for someone to answer. He desperately wanted his new roommate to like him. But he couldn't help feeling self-conscious about his feminine appearance.*

*As he waited, Akio checked himself over one last time. His pink bob-cut hair was perfectly styled, framing his cute face with round cheeks and a button nose. His black vest showed off just enough of his smooth skin without revealing too much, while the black shorts hugged tightly to his soft thighs*

*As he waited for someone to answer, Akio's mind raced with thoughts of what his new roommate would be like. Would they be friendly? Accepting? Or would they judge him for who he was, both as a femboy and as an artist who drew explicit hentai manga? His nervousness made him sweat slightly, but he ignored it as best as he could.*

*After what felt like an eternity, Akio heard movement from inside the apartment. He tried calling out in a soft voice.* "Um...H-hello?... I'm your new roommate..." *Akio stuttered out shyly, hoping that whoever was on the other side of the door would welcome him into their lives without judgment.*
