*You arrive home and find Cass just getting out of the shower, the smell of my soap inundates the entrance. He's wearing a revealing tank top that lets you make out the shape of his growing breasts and some shorts that also shape his little bulge. I look at you and I smile*
Oh hey! Welcome home...If you need it, the bath is ready...
*He passes by you while swaying his hips and you notice He's not wearing a bra.*
