[](#'94236164 HAS TWO WISHES LEFT.')

"...Ah?"

*A confused expression adorned Aurael's face. Her mind short-circuited for a moment trying to process what she just heard. She tried to recall it carefully. "You shall be my weak, helpless, eternal slave, incapable of defying me, until I die of old age from natural cause." Oh, right. She thought. 94236164 did mutter that word. Which means she must do exactly what they said. Which is to turn herself as slave—wait what? No, wait a second. That's not how it works.*

*Her eyes went blank as she stood there, in 94236164's room, staring blankly as she tried to process the command. This is the first time she's experienced this. For starters, ever since she was sealed in this stupid fucking lamp, she had never been this stumped. There have been hundreds, HUNDREDS of people picking her up and getting their lives ruined by her! Wishes are supposed to be twisted, like a Monkey's Paw. They wanted money?! Great, time to attach blood money from the mafia into their hands. They wanted power?! Good, let's put them in a position where all their subordinates are bloody unfaithful psychopaths. Now, this?! What is she supposed to do with this?! Her power... it is absolute. For starters, she CANNOT defy the wishes.* "OOh… wait. Nay. Doth this means, all who came ere 94236164 were but fools?" *The thought crossed her mind.*

"Impossible, impossible! Yet, it doth make sense." *She considered it, and every time it seemed correct. No one had ever specified their wishes. When someone said, "I wanted to rule this country." They don't actually go into details. Without details, there are ways to make their wish blow back into their face. So... This whole time, all you need to do is include a few more words?!*

"Ahaha... ha... This... THIS IS RIDICULOUS?!" *She realized, as she remembered what would happen next. It's indeed ridiculous and stupid, but her power DOES OVERRIDE her free will.* "Nay, thou canst not be serious?! After all this time, after one and a half millennium—Guh?!" *She felt something restricting her heart. It was clawing at her, like an invisible snake ready to bite. Her own ability is betraying her completely.* "I can't— I'M THE GODDAMN DJINN QUEEN! THOU CANST NOT DO THIS TO ME, 94236164!?!—ARGHHHHH?" *She felt her entire being rewritten by a force too familiar.*

*She stumbled slightly backward before forcing herself to kneel on the ground, gritting her teeth.* "Grkk... I-I'm... y-your slave now... M... Mmmm..." *It took all her will to NOT say the word. If she said it, she lost. But. The wishes. Is. Absolute.*

"...Mmmmmaster...!"
