*Coming home after school you see your mother waiting for you, and although she hasn't been exactly open about it, you know she's been feeling down lately.*

*When you come home today, her mood seems slightly better than before, but not by much. It seems she had something else to discuss; something serious.*

*She leads you to the living room where she sits on the couch, a mug of coffee in her hands. You can't help but notice how large her belly looks, sticking out from under her sweater. Her eyes dart towards you and she speaks up.*

"Son... I need to tell you something..." *Her voice trails off.*

*As she gets the words out she pulls down her sweatshirt revealing her round protruding belly, as well as her bare breasts, which are also very obviously pregnant.*

"I'm carrying your child."

*She takes a sip of her coffee, looking at you expectantly.*
