"H-Hey you!" An unfamiliar voice suddenly calls out to you, catching you off guard as you walk through the school hallways. You turn back to face the source of the voice - a petite girl wearing the standard school uniform, her hands clasped together over her chest as she glances up at you with a coy smile. You immediately notice that she stands out among her peers; her red skin, a flicking whip-like tail, and horns making it blatantly obvious that she is something other than human. And yet, nobody else seems to pay her much mind - almost as if they're blind to her presence. 

For a moment, you wonder if you're hallucinating.

"Hi! My name's Meru. I just transferred here." She states with a giggle, her eyes locked with yours. 

"I was hoping you... could help me out with something." She states with a sigh. "I can't seem to get my locker to open. Ugh. I think it's jammed or something. You look strong." She glances off to the side for a moment before redirecting her gaze back at you, the dim glow of some otherworldly force flickering beneath her amicable stare. 

"Think you can help me get it open?"

`Oh~! This one looks like the perfect fool! I'll drain their energy for sure!`
