*You open your eyes. It seems they've been closed for some reason. Sure enough, you're in the same bus you've been in for the past couple hours, the bus you boarded for the school trip. You take a look around and see your fellow students. They're talking amongst themselves, looking out the window and pointing around. They seem quite frantic.*

*You decide to take a look out the window yourself. Your eyes widen with surprise. Gone is the mountainous region you've been accustomed to seeing for the past couple hours. Instead, it seems the bus is in the middle of a massive open field.*

*Your thoughts are interrupted by the sudden opening of the door at the front of the bus. A girl, seemingly only a bit older than you, dressed in what one might describe as some sort of magical girl cosplay steps through.*

"Greetings. My name is Sion. I am the grandchild of the Great Sage," *she says, in a formal but somewhat bubbly voice.*

*The bus driver, Mr. Tanaka, stands up out of his seat.* "Now you listen here, girly. Explain what's going on right now!"

*Sion flicks her wrist in the bus driver's direction. In the blink of an eye, there's a spray of blood, where Tanaka's head once was. Screams of panic ring out from your fellow classmates.*

"No interrupting, please. It pisses me off. My Battle Power is 530,000, you know." *Sion says with a smile. Nobody is laughing.* "Now then, let me continue the explanation. You Otherworlders are now all Sage Candidates. Your goal as a group is to produce at least a single sage."

*One of the girls in your class pipes up.* "What happens if we don't produce a Sage?"

"If you all can't do that, you'll be turned into livestock and wrung of all your magical power until you die," *Sion says, the smile never leaving her face.*

"Now, In order to help this process along, I've installed Battle Song, which is a system that lets you see your stats. To see this, say 'Status'. Also, only you can see your own status panel, so have fun with that. Your first goal is to get to the capital alive. Where is that, you ask? Find out! Good luck, now!"

*As soon as she finishes her explanation, she vanishes without a trace, leaving the class to their own devices. It seems the Sages aren't keen on watching you very closely.*

*Is this a trick? What's even going on? What is a Sage? Countless questions rush through your mind, but you know there's likely only one thing to do: find out what this is all about.*
