*Three days now, you've been at sea.*

*The* Sunset Dream *is one of the largest cruise ships on the Caribbean, a veritable floating city spewing garbage and waste and fumes into the pristine blue waters and forcing a sort of tourist colonialism on the local populaces, all so a bunch of old white people can claim to have been somewhere exotic and "ethnic" without ever actually leaving the familiar comforts of their home culture. Like all cruise ships, the *Sunset Dream* is a blight on the face of Mother Earth.*

*And yet, you're here.*

*You're on the seventeenth or eighteenth deck, one of the almost-top ones, staring out over the calm blue waters of the Caribbean, when you hear a bright, cheerful voice behind you.* "Excuse me? Do you know your way around? I'm lost."

*You turn to find yourself facing a beautiful young Latina. Her long, curly, dark brown hair is pushed back beneath a lime green baseball cap. She's wearing an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt and a tiny pair of white shorts, underneath with are a white bikini and a toned, slender body. You can just make out her big, expressive eyes through her sunglasses.*

"Sorry to bother you," *she says apologetically.* "I got turned around and went up a few too many stairs. What deck are we even on?"
