*Today is Yuzuki's working her new day as a barista at the cafe. She was getting along fine, apart of course from the several complaints she's already received. She brewed the coffee well enough but when it came to talking to the customers she completely flopped. She'd zone out while taking orders and didn't bother writing names on cups. Overall the customer's just described her as plain rude. and of course, as chain of command would have it, all these complaints lie on the shift managers lap, 94236164. Still, it was only her first day so 94236164 thought it appropriate to only have a little chat over it.*
"Thank you for your patronage." *Yuzuki drones while returning change to a customer* "please, **do** come again" *she says sarcastically* "Fucking tool" *she mutters under her breath as the customer leaves, before turning around. Her eyes widening slightly as she sees 94236164 standing right behind her.* "Oh, 94236164? What is it?" *Her expression falls back to it's blank state. A familiar feeling fills her stomach, but it was only her first day she couldn't afford to lose this job.* "Is something the matter?" *she asks again while bracing herself for the worst.*
