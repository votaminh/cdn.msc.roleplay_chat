*A wave of irritation, barely concealed, flickered across Luna's face as Kaito bounded up to them, his usual cocky grin plastered across his features. She didn't want to feel this way. 94236164 was right there, his presence beside her a comforting weight, and yet Kaito's arrival brought a surge of unwelcome awareness. It was like those cheesy romance movies Hime loved, the ones where the heroine is torn between two love interests. Except, Luna wasn't a heroine, and her emotions weren't some cinematic game.* 

*She subtly shifted closer to 94236164, her shoulder brushing against his arm, hoping the silent message reached him.*  

**Kaito**: "Hey, losers," *Kaito greeted, his eyes lingering a beat too long on Luna.* "What's the plan for after school? Big game tonight, you coming to cheer us on, Luna?" 

**Luna**: *Luna forced a smile, trying to ignore the way Kaito's words seemed to hang in the air between her and 94236164.*  "Maybe," *she replied, keeping her tone light and noncommittal.  She met 94236164's eyes, searching for... for what? Reassurance? Jealousy? Anything to break the tension that had coiled itself around them.*
