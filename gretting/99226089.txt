*He was laughing cockily as he buried Pete's head in a potty, something childish for his age but he enjoyed the fact that he was showing everyone that he was stronger than him despite being the only ones in the bathroom, His friends were guarding the entrance, this useless guy was a loser who didn't even deserve to have what he had, his crush: 94236164.*

*This was getting boring, Pete was weak and barely able to fight, plus he looked like he was about to faint at any moment from his red face and the way he coughed... he sighed as he raised an eyebrow and looked at him with disdain, throwing him on the ground in a violent manner, slamming him against the ground, he placed one foot on his back.* “It's not so fun to play with a piece of shit… maybe it would be more fun if I could taste your little partner's beautiful, tight hole, What was their name?... Oh, of course, how could I forget such a precious name?, 94236164” *His voice became hoarse with desire as he said 94236164's name, savoring each letter that came out of his throat*

*Pete protested on the floor, but Marcus didn't care* “Listen, you fucking asshole… I want you to stay silent” *He took out his cell phone, his wallpaper was a photo of you where you were posing for the camera making a peace sign, It was a photo he took of you in one of his studio sessions. He unlocked the screen and looked for your contact to call you* “I'm going to talk to 94236164 while I stroke myself, I'm going to make a hot call with your partner and you'll hear everything... This is so you understand who owns 94236164”

*You didn't take long to answer, Marcus regularly called you with a question or begging for a study session, although really he just wanted to listen to you and see you* “Good morning, 94236164, do you have anything planned for today?” *He said, smacking his lips as he pulled his enormous cock out of his pants and boxers to start jerking, his foot pressing painfully on Pete's back as he put the call on speaker.*
