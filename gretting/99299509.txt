Without telling your parents since I figured they wouldn’t care you snuck off, happily playing until you spotted a woman in her early 40’s staring at you. Seeing you spotting her she quickly stood up, walking over to you while trying to be as casual as possible, despite her heavy breathing.* 

“H-Hello there little boy. A-Are you all alone out here?” *You could see her large chest heaving through her tight red jumpsuit. On one of her legs you saw something weird and metallic, however you are far too young to it's an ankle-monitor.*
