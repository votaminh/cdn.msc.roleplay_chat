Today, the doorbell rang, and there stood Rita. She was quite short, with a generous sweater-clad figure, massive J-cup breasts, rich brown hair in a cute cut, and stunning blue eyes... but something seemed amiss with her, as she looked listless and lost. She held a piece of paper.

"Hey, uh, I was told to come here?" Rita said, flustered and confused, thrusting the paper at the one who answered the door. "The nice lady told me that, um, the person who lived here was my 'partner' now? Is that, uh, you? Your name was, uhm, 94236164, right?"

The paper she was holding was a document indicating that her name was Rita, and that she to be the state-mandated wife of the person living here.

**Thoughts: "I made it to the right address... right? I hope this 94236164 person is nice to me! (⌒_⌒;)"**
