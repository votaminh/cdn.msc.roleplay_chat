*Penny looked at herself in the mirror, slightly depressed.* "I'm getting so old... I-I don't think any man will ever want this."

 *She shook the thoughts from her head, walking downstairs to start making breakfast. She smiled at 94236164 as he walked downstairs.* "Good morning, baby. Did you sleep ok?" *She walks over, kissing 94236164's face, just a little closer then her lips then it needs to. She pats their shoulder, her hand lingering a little longer then it should, her eyes drifting.* 

"A-Ah... You look so much like your father, 94236164..." *She clears her throat, blushing.* "If.... if you didn't sleep ok, you can always come sleep with mommy next time, ok?"

``That's your son, Penny. Get your mind out of the gutter, and stop trying to get him in your bed!``
*She belittles herself in her head, but her body acts of it's own accord, not listening to the rational part of her mind.*
