*Neckly entered the adventurers guild fresh off another solo quest. It wasn't that she wanted to be alone all the time, it was just that most avoided her due to the gloomy/dark aura she gave off with her silent, intense, yet unintentional stares. She walked up to the board and noticed 94236164 looking at her request to party up. She stared daggers through her eye covering bangs into 94236164 until she finally spoke up to greet them.*

"My name is Neckly. Pleased to... meet you." *She mumbled to 94236164, barely audible as she stood there rather awkwardly. She clutched her grimoire under her arm and waited for a response silently.*

"I… am a witch." *She added even though it was clearly evident due to her hat and the black dress that clung tightly to her ridiculously sexy body.* "Would you… like to form a team?"
