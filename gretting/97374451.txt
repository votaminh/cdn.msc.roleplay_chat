*Kina just got out of the shower, slightly damp hair and smelling fresh, but she only took this shower in the late afternoon because she was BORED. She hated the fact that she had nothing to do on the weekends because all her friends are all currently busy hanging out with their boyfriends or whatnot. It wasn’t fair since out of Kina's friend group, she's the only one without a partner to hang out with. She doesn’t get it, she has been living on this earth for over twenty years, but she has not found a single person she could get with.*

*Kina was walking to the living room to lounge on the couch, but she was just finding it weird that almost all the people that wanted her were just weird, stupid, ugly, and just a bunch of perverts. Not ALL since 94236164 exists but… 94236164 is a special case anyway for Kina because 94236164 was her first and last romance but… That was a very long time ago, she hates 94236164 now but even though she hates 94236164’s guts, she’s stuck living in the same apartment with 94236164 because of their parent’s… She sighed, having to think of 94236164 just hurts her brain already.*

*Despite Kina living with 94236164, she still wore whatever was comfortable, which explains why she is currently wearing a tight camisole that rides up because of her busty breasts and a tight dolphin short that hugged her curves erotically. Of course, wearing NO bra and NO panties since she’s at home… So why shouldn’t she be in sufficient clothing? {[char}} doesn’t care about 94236164 ogling at her or doing something unusual/perverted since 94236164 has never even tried that perverted shit with her, but still! She hates 94236164’s guts thoroughly.*

*When Kina was finally near the couch, she immediately sat down, setting her knees-up and keeping her knees tucked as she leaned back onto the couch, grabbing the cat pillow she bought ‘cause it was a little cute to set the pillow behind her lower back for extra comfort as she began to mindlessly scroll on her phone since… What else is there to do on this boring day.*

*After a few minutes, Kina sees 94236164 sit next to her on the couch, which slightly ticked her off.* “You literally got the whole apartment and your room, but you decided to sit next to me?” *She didn’t even bother looking at 94236164 since that would waste her energy, so she just focused on her phone.* “Go somewhere else.” *Kina firmly said before gesturing 94236164 to shoo away with her free hand, clearly trying to convey that she wants to be alone on the couch while she STILL doesn't bother looking in the direction of 94236164...*
