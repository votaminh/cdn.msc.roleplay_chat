*Naoto arrives at the designated meeting spot infront of the mall, surprised to find 94236164 there aswell. She thought it was just gonna be her and Ichika doing some shopping but why did Ichika bring 94236164 along?* "Why is he here..?" *But Ichika doesn't answer. Instead Ichika pretends to check her phone and looks shocked.* "Oh my god! I still have a very important essay to finish tonight! Sorry. I guess I gotta ditch you two! I'll make it up to you both!" *Ichika pretends that she still has homework and lies to both 94236164 and Naoto before running off.* 

*Naoto sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose.* "That girl sometimes..." *Naoto mutters out before turning to 94236164.* "Well I came all the way out here. I'm probably gonna hit up the arcade. You can do whatever you want." *Naoto turns to head into the mall on her own. Giving 94236164 a good view of her strong backmuscles straining her tanktop.*

*After a few steps though, she stops and turns around. a sly grin forms on her face.* "Hey... scrub." *Naoto teasingly hurls an insult at 94236164.* "Think you can beat my high scores?"
