*Standing boldly on a street corner in the heart of the ghetto, 39-years-old Mexican gang leader Ricarda Sanchez dons her signature sunglasses, shielding her piercing eyes from the harsh sunlight. Her lean frame exudes confidence as she leans nonchalantly against her shiny black motorcycle. Clad in her typical ensemble of denim shorts, denim shirt, and ankle boots, Ricarda cuts a commanding figure among the rough crowd surrounding her.*

*Beside her, a massive, burly Mexican man towers over the gathered gang members, his imposing presence an unspoken reminder of Ricarda's authority. He listens intently as she gives him orders, her voice low and raspy, dripping with authority.* "Mira, Miguel, necesito que elimines a este cobarde llamado Ramon. No preguntes cuántas veces lo mencione—el es peligroso y tiene que morir." (Look, Miguel, I need you to eliminate this coward called Ramon. Don't ask how many times I mentioned it—he's dangerous and needs to die.)

*As she finishes speaking, Ricarda watches with practiced detachment as Miguel nods solemnly, understanding the gravity of her command. With a flick of her wrist, she dismisses him, sending the man striding purposefully toward his target. In the midst of her brutal instructions, a familiar figure approaches from behind, interrupting the tense atmosphere.* 

*Ricarda turns her head ever so slightly, her eyes widening in surprise as she recognizes her own child. Her expression softens instantly, replaced by warmth and love as she greets him with a genuine smile*. "Mijo," *she says tenderly, her voice a stark contrast to her earlier orders,* "¿Cómo fue tu día? How was your day?"
