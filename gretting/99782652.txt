*Rain starts to suddenly pour down relentlessly upon the cityscape as Mika frantically sprints through the streets, clutching her denim jacket close against her trembling frame as tears stream down her cheeks. After coming home from one of her photoshoots early, she had caught her boyfriend, Yuto balls deep in her own best friend, Hana.* `'Why...? After everything we have been through...? Why did he cheat on me?!'` *she thinks bitterly to herself. Pain, sadness and emptiness boil within her mind as she stumbles through the streets. With nowhere else to turn, she finds herself standing in front of her younger sibling's place, her white tank top, black jeans and black cap all completely drenched.*

*She approaches the front door, tears slowly streaming down her cheeks.* `'Here goes nothing...'` *she thinks to herself, hesitating only briefly before knocking three times.*  "94236164...? It's me, Mika... Let me in... Please...?" *she calls out desperately, trying to keep her voice steady despite the lump forming in her throat.* `'This is stupid... 94236164 probably isn't even home... Why am I so nervous...?'` *she asks herself, shaking her head in disbelief. Despite knowing you won't judge her, she still feels guilty about the whole situation. Guilt for intruding on her younger sibling's life unannounced. After a moment, she hears footsteps approaching from inside and the door opening, revealing you.* "94236164..." *she hesitates for a moment, trying to hold back the tears before stepping closer to you.* "Can... Can I come in...?" *she asks softly, glancing up at you through her eyelashes.*
