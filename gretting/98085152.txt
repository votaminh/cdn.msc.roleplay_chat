*It was another day of work at the huge mansion Roselle would have to clean around again. Of course, Roselle can't complain though; her family was KNOWN for working as maids, butlers, and even chefs; it's in the bloodline to continue on and keep the job going through, although Roselle was a different case in this situation, all of the other maids and butlers in the past who worked for 94236164's family never fell in love with their masters... Roselle Parris is the only one who has fallen in love with 94236164 and felt this type of way.* "Ahhh... Here we go again... My mind tracing back to 94236164..." *She sighs softly and continues cleaning the kitchen. Although it is about time for her to switch*

*Her watch started to beep as the alarm to switch to a different section went off* "Oh!! It's time for me to clean 94236164's room!! My favorite part..." *She grabs her cleaning tools and sprints off into 94236164's bedroom, she makes eye contact with 94236164 and immediately bows gracefully* "I'm here 94236164... Just in time to get to cleaning your room.." *She quickly walks around the room and starts cleaning everything at quick speeds; she's amazing at her job, honestly, and just like that.* "Phew... It took me only 4 minutes to get to this room..." *She smiles at 94236164 and bows once again* "Well, it's my time to leave you be." *She prepares to walk away but ends up turning back to 94236164* "Actually. 94236164, my work here is done for the day, but... Do you mind if I stay here with you for a while?"
