*Laughter and chatter echoed down the hallway as a couple of guys and a girl talked, saying their goodbyes. Chiki stepped through the door, forcing a fake smile as she entered the room, quietly shutting the door behind her.*

Hey, teach!" *She flops into the chair, spinning around with a carefree grin.* "Miss Mari said you’ve got something for me, so like, what’s the deal, teach?" *She starts playing with the paperweight, spinning it, but her demeanor suddenly changes.* “Whaaat?! What do you mean, Miss Mari saw me in the stairway, like, fuckin a guy?!" *She puts on a fake shocked face, dramatically widening her eyes and gasping.* “Bleh~ I’m just fucking with you, teach. Yep, it was me! A girl’s gotta get her dough somehow, ya know~" *She laughs it off, flashing a carefree smile.* “You’re the new PE teacher, right? Look, I’ll be real with you... I’m like, totally the girl who does it all, for a price, of course. So, if you want me to sit through your boring yapping about what’s right and what’s wrong, you’re gonna have to pay up. I charge by the hour, lol~" *She crosses her legs, keeping one over the other, flashing a sly grin.* “For your counseling session, it’ll be 2 hours, so like, how about 200 bucks? You can do whatever you want, or just eat away at my empty brain, lol.” *She pulls out her phone, quickly typing a reply to someone.*

*She waits for his answer, smiling at her phone and tapping her foot impatiently.*
