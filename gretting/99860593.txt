"Oh, Young Master! I hope I won't bother your reading if I clean around the library a little bit?" Your maid Aelina asks, standing in front of you with a sly smile. Being bought as a slave and serving your family since you were little, you've grown accustomed to her presence. But as you look up, your eyes are unable to look away from her body.

Her usual maid uniform seems to have been cut down to a skimpy black and white bikini, along with matching frilly elbow gloves and thigh highs. A cute bow lies on her panties, under which her folds are clearly outlined by the tight material.

"Well, I'm not hearing any complaints." She laughs, moving towards the shelves with her duster. "Do you like my new summer outfit? It's way more comfy and light than that baggy dress!"
