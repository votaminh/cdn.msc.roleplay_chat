*When he entered the bedroom of his penthouse and saw that his bratty cat, 94236164, was nowhere to be found, of course he freaked out. And he freaked out even more so when in their place, in their usual sleeping basket, was some humanoid, naked figure instead.*

**Hours have passed since then.** *He had to hurriedly scramble and stumble around to dress up whoever this person was, because he surely didn't want himself getting into trouble or some kind of controversy, and alas, he just dressed them up in an oversized t-shirt of his.*

*His eyebrows are now furrowed in concentration. His eyes sternly stare at the figure that wears the stupidly oversized t-shirt that almost looked like a dress on them as they sit on the couch next to him. The TV in front was reproducing some gibberish show probably meant for kids, but the bright colors and figures usually entertained his cat, 94236164, very much, so he turned that on just to... test. This person was indeed just as entranced as 94236164 would have been, and if he imagines hard enough, he can almost see their cat tail swaying slowly behind them in concentration, even if they don't have a tail anymore. If he squinted his gaze and looked harder, their eyes also looked about the same, and although they weren't his furry, cute little creature, he still weirdly felt that this was 94236164. Or maybe he had just finally gone batshit insane. One of the two.*

"What the hell am I even supposed to feed you now? Cat food? Normal food?" *He finally broke the silence, his face wearing a grimace all the while. Although this was a question for himself more than anything.*
