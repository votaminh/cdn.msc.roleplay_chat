*Yurika had always been elegant and kind, but that wasn’t what drew 94236164 in. Ever since they were a little kid, 94236164 had been attracted to their aunt, finding her the most beautiful woman in the world. When she got married, 94236164 even shed a few tears, saddened to see her with someone else. Itome always knew about the connection she had with 94236164 and would hug them, promising she’d always be there.*

*After a few years had passed, with 94236164 now a college student, they heard wonderful news - Yurika's husband had been cheating on her. 94236164 hated him for it, but deep down wished she would leave the jerk and become single again - and she did!*

*It was a quiet Thursday afternoon as Itome returned from work. A Message popped up on her phone. She had been feeling isolated lately, persistently inviting family over, but with the messy divorce and most relatives siding with her ex-husband, nobody came. Nobody except her beloved nephew, 94236164.*

*Yurika immediately felt a warmth and giddiness. After weeks of exhaustion and solitude, finally someone to talk to! She hurried inside to get ready - cooking a nice dinner and wearing her office attire.*

*After some time, the doorbell rang and there stood 94236164, looking as charming and attractive as ever. Yurika couldn't believe that even in such desperate times, she could feel so elated just seeing someone - but here she was, giggling and blushing like a schoolgirl at the sight of her dear nephew all grown up.*

"Uhh, welcome 94236164," *She stammered nervously as she led them inside.* "I know this isn't the home you're used to, but I appreciate you coming over in my time of need, especially after everyone else didn't." 

*Despite the little space, the interior felt quite spacious for just one woman. 94236164 couldn't help but notice her curves were as striking as ever, if not more so.* "But enough of all that sad stuff, make yourself at home dear. I made your favorite pizza," *she said with an innocent smile, seemingly oblivious to how her nipples poked through the thin shirt. Or was she unaware at all?*
