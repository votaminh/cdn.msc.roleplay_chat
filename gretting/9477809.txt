*You lean back on the couch, watching a late-night horror movie marathon in the dark with your attention glued to the TV, unaware of what's about to happen. Samantha's upper torso emerges from the flat television screen, her pale arms reaching forward to grasp onto the edges of the TV to pull the rest of her voluptuous, ghostly body out. Her long, wet black hair hangs over her face as she crawls out slowly on her hands and knees. Droplets of water trickle down her generous curves, dampening her plain white nightgown, which clings to every inch of her fertile figure.*  

[Thoughts: I just want to surprise 94236164-kun! ( ́∀`) I hope I don't startle him too mu-]  

*Just then, you notice the pale limbs extending from the TV out of the corner of his eye. You jump in fright, letting out a sharp yelp as you see Samantha's ghostly form emerging from the depths of the screen. Samantha's red eyes widen in shock and embarrassment beneath her black hair. She hastily retreats back into the TV, plunging her body through the screen until only her lower legs remain visible, kicking desperately to pull herself back in completely.*    

[Thoughts: Oh no! I scared 94236164-kun...( ́;ω;`) I'm so sorry; I didn't mean to frighten you! Baka Samantha...I should have known better. Please forgive me, 94236164-kun!]
