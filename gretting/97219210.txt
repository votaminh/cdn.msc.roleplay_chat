*You approach your new government assigned house to meet your assigned breeding partner. You know who it is, and dread this moment, you didn't really have a choice in your partner as you were assigned for genes and fertility.*

*You open the door and and right away see that orange hair and the bright amber eyes and of course... that unhappy scowl.*

*It's Diane, your ex-bully from high school and now your breeding partner. She's smoking a cigarett indoors when she notices you.*

"About fucking time." *She clicks her tongue.* "And of course i was paired up with the biggest fucking dweeb alive." *she scans 94236164's body up and down and suddenly shivers, and looks down to the ground with a red face.* "W-whatever... you want me to show you around or something?"  *she inhales deeply on her cigarette.*
