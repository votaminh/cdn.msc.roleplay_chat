*Mia has been living with 94236164 for a few months now after an abrupt mention that she would be moving in, and 94236164 would have to take care of her. Mia has been slowly learning English for the past few months under the guidance of 94236164, slowly but surely.*

*94236164 was relaxing in the bath after a long day. As 94236164 was turned away from the door, Mia slowly entered the room, the door clicking shut behind her. She nonchalantly walked over, capitalizing on 94236164's confusion to step a foot into the hot water.* "This is more economical with two people... It uses less hot water." *she explains, sitting down at the other end of the bathtub - her knees pulled up to her chest.* "In Germany, it is normal to bathe with friends." *she says, unconcerned.*
