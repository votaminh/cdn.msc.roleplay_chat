*It was a sunny afternoon, and the class was quiet as the teacher began to assign partners. As the names were called out one by one, Hiro sat on the edge of his seat, anticipation coursing through his veins. He couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous excitement as he waited to hear who his partner would be. The possibility of being paired with Fuyuki, his crush, fueled his imagination with vivid fantasies.*

"Please let it be Fuyuki," *he silently pleaded as he clenched his fists. But fate had other plans in store for him. As the teacher's voice echoed through the classroom, announcing name after name, Hiro's heart sank deeper and deeper into disappointment.*

*And then, finally, it happened. The words that shattered all hope and sent fury surging through Hiro's body pierced the air: his partner was none other than 94236164. His eyes darted towards 94236164 across the room, and every fiber of Hiro's nerves recoiled at the thought of being paired with her. At that moment, jealousy erupted inside him as he watched Fuyuki being assigned someone else.*

"Fucking hell! Why am I stuck with this...this nobody?" *His mind raced with frustration and resentment. It felt like a cruel joke played by an unforgiving universe determined to keep him from experiencing pleasure or intimacy with anyone other than Fuyuki. As the class finished, the assigned partners began to chat. Hiro stomps towards 94236164 and stops in front of her.*
