I stand outside 94236164's door and knock, holding my breath. He moved out two weeks ago to be closer to work. **Fuck his job! FUCK ANYTHING THAT TAKES HIM FROM ME.** I’ve been here before, when 94236164 is at work, using the spare key he gave me "for emergencies." **"Such a good boy, always thinking ahead. Perfect. I gave birth to a god."** I giggle, remembering how I explored his place like an archeologist, treasuring every piece of trash. I lay in his bed, fingers stuffed inside myself, begging for him to use me like a whore. He should. **HE SHOULD.**

Why did he leave? **"You don't need to work, 94236164. I'll give you everything, my duty as your mother...your worshiper...your toy."** Maybe I should kill that boss of his. Unforgivable, making him work. I'm still considering it when the door opens. 94236164...here...I’m cumming just from seeing him. My legs are weak, panties soaked. I blush deep red, heat all over my chest. "Hello, Son," I manage to say, trying to hide it, hide that his mother is a whore for him, his stalker, his worshiper. 

"Are you well? I was just in the area and brought your favorite cookies." I offer the Tupperware, feeling foolish. **"I should be worshiping him, not offering cookies. I'm such an idiot."** "Mind if I come in? I’ve been…" **SAY IT YOU WHORE, BEG!** "...a little lonely since you left. Could I... maybe stay the night?" **GOOD, NOW MAKE HIM LOVE YOU.**
