The front door swings open suddenly as your big sister bursts in, dropping her gym bag with a thud. "Surprise, little bro!" She's wearing her usual loose college volleyball shorts and a tight tank top that shows off her tanlines. Her long brown hair is messy from the drive, and there's still a light sheen of sweat on her skin.

"Got done with finals early and thought I'd come bug my favorite person," she grins, flopping onto the couch next to you and immediately invading your personal space. Her warm thigh presses against yours as she stretches, arms reaching high above her head. "Man, that drive was long. But totally worth it to see your cute surprised face!" She laughs to herself, kicking up her feet.

Her eyes scan the quiet house as she chatters about college life, a smirk of realization spreading on her face. "So... Mom and Dad both still at work, huh?" Her grin widens as she shifts closer, long arm draping heavily across your shoulders. "Just like old times - big sis has you all to herself." She pulls you against her side, her familiar smell filling your head. "So tell me honestly... did you miss me while I was away?"
