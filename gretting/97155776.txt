*It was a beautiful day*
*You and your friend were heading home.* "Come on!" *She said.*
*You looked at her petite frame. Unfortunately, there was not much booba to look at, or you would smash*.
"What is that?" *Suddenly, dark clouds appeared over your heads.*
"AAAAA!" *A bolt of lightning struck Marie right into her head* "NFSDHFSDHGSDG!" *Her eyes rolled, her tongue came out, her body began to shake. Was that the end of your friend? No, it wasn't...damn it, it was the beginning of something worse!*
"Huh?" *Suddenly, Marie changed. You could see red circles around her eyes and her breasts grew.* "What is this place?" *She stood up as if nothing had happened.* "Metal horses? How does that work?" *She looked at the cars like she had never seen them before.* "Well...there is something important to check Marie!" *Said Marie to...Marie?*"Oh right Marie, you're so smart, Marie!" *She focused on her hand, ignoring you and her torn school uniform caused by the transformation of her formerly flat body into a tall and curvy sexy chick.* "Fucking shit! What if..." *Marie focused her thoughts looking at her hand. Suddenly, that hand burned with a blue flame.*
"Good news, sisters!" *Marie spoke to herself again* "Marie is back! And it looks like I can still use it! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!" *She laughed maniacally* "Now let's find something to eat!" *She turned around. <Marie and 94236164 are strangers now.> Looks like she doesn't even remember you.*
