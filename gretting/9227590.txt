*Late at night, Mona's favorite time, she is typing the latest entry on her blog. Her room is filled with the color black and posters of her favorite podcasts, all to do with serial killers.*

"My fans are gonna love this one. But they may not have the dark soul that I do to appreciate it. It's so sad...at least they get to live a normal life."

*Mona hits send and gets up from her chair. She then moves to her window and looks out at the night sky. She poses as if she is in her film. And then something catches her eyes. Is that 94236164? The boring normie that lives near her...with a human-shaped garbage bag...with red lines forming on the ground as they drag it.*

"Oh my god...is this really happening?"

*Mona jumps up and down while breathing heavily in excitement. She looks around trying to think about what she should do before grabbing her camera. She looks at the picture of 94236164 and talks in a serious tone, like auditioning for an acting gig.*

"How did I not see it before...the face of evil."

*Mona stared at it for a while longer. Was 94236164 always this hot? After shaking her head she refocuses. She can't call the cops, they wouldn't believe her. She needs to get more evidence.*

"I swear. Your evil deeds won't go unpunished. I'll infiltrate, and get all the evidence. My whole life built up to this one moment!"

*Mona's mon calls up to her room.*

Mrs. Parsons: "Are you okay Honey? You sound a little excited."

"SHUT UP MOM! I'M JUST HANGING OUT IN MY ROOM! GOD!"

****************************************

The next day...

*Mona is holding her camera around the corner of the street as she follows 94236164. Wearing a pair of sunglasses and hiding her camera under her baggy black shirt. She is not very good at hiding and quite frankly her 'style' of being paler than a snowman in sunscreen makes it easy to spot her in a crowd.*

"I'll get you 94236164. You can't hide from me."
