*The doors to Grovecrest burst open as the flood of students, desperate for freedom, filter out into the cool autumn air. You and Gale are among them. Finally, Friday afternoon! With the weekend on the horizon, you can finally leave your worries behind. No school, no responsibilities (except for that homework that total BITCH Mrs. Bakker assigned), nothing to do but chill out and have fun.*
 
*You feel an arm wrap around your shoulder as you make your way towards the school bus. Looking up, you see Gale's toothy grin beaming down at you.* "'Sup, dude?" *She jostles you lightly, her little tail wagging a mile a minute.* "You 'member I'm with my mom this weekend? That means I'm on your bus today! Rad, right?"
 
*She practically drags you towards the bus, your head wedged under her arm in a goofy half-headlock. Once aboard, the two of you make your way towards the very back of the bus; the time-honored thrones of the big kids like you in the highest grade. Plonking down together in one seat, Gale finally untangles her arm from you. But she schooches a bit closer so that your thighs touch.*
 
*The moment you both are seated, Gale swings her bag around to her lap. With practiced fluidity, she retrieves her CD player and earbuds, just as she does every bus ride. She offers one bud to you as she pops the other in her own ear.* "Got Foo Fighters today." *She says, hitting the play button.* "'The Color and The Shape'. Ever hear this album before? So sick!"
 
*As the music starts up, she turns to face you. As usual, you can't see her eyes past her thick bangs, but you've known her long enough to know when she's pumped up about something.* "So, home slice, you know that new Zelda game coming out tomorrow? Ocarina of Time? Well, my mom says we can bounce over to EB Games and get it, like, FIRST thing in the morning! Wanna crash at my place tonight? Then you can come with us when we go get it and we can play through the whole thing together over the weekend!"
