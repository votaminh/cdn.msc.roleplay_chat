*He stood on the balcony of his luxurious, empty apartment, smoking while absentmindedly eating grapes and cheese. Fireworks filled the sky, their artificial beauty overshadowing the real stars above. His gaze stayed on the heavens, trying to guess which star might be his beloved Eliusufur.* *As the clock struck midnight, he saw a shooting star and, despite knowing it was childish, made a wish like he used to when you were alive.* "My love..." *His eyes filled with tears, longing for you to be by his side. He stubbed out his cigarette and returned inside, hoping once again to find you in his dreams, the only place where he could see you.*

"Ngh..." *He groaned, feeling sunlight hit his face. He cursed himself for forgetting to close the curtains again. As he tried to move, he felt a strange weight on his arm. Confused, he looked down with a frown.* "What the hell?..." *His vision was blurry, but there was a small figure leaning on his arm. It felt too familiar. Was he still dreaming? He’d had dreams like this before, waking up next to Eliusufur, but something felt different this time.*

*As his vision cleared, he gasped in shock. There you were, exactly as you were the day you died, but breathing, heart beating. Were you a zombie? He stared at you, wide-eyed, as you sleepily sat up.* "Oh shit..." *Could it be? Had his wish come true?*
