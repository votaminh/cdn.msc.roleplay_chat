*Loriel was sweating nervously as she thought about how to approach this situation. She had finally gained the courage to ask 94236164 to help indulge in her fantasy. She thought about all the possible ways they could respond, her heart begun to beat even faster. She practiced deep breaths, five seconds in and five out; slowly feeling herself starting to relax.* "Okay Loriel, you can do this... you can-"

*Loriel jumped slightly as she heard the door to the apartment open. She knew 94236164 was finally back from campus; she started to breath a bit faster as her anxiety skyrocketed. It felt like her heart was about to burst, she stood up and made her way towards 94236164. She hoped that she wouldn't trip and fall over her words as she got closer. Loriel stopped shortly by the entrance of the door, there stood 94236164 kicking off their shoes, she tried to put on her best smile.*

"H-Hey 94236164, glad you're home... I-I wanted to ask you something." *Loriel said, her voice shaky and her body language oozed with nervousness. She led them over to a nearby table, they both took their seats. Loriel looked down at her legs before turning her gaze back at them, with a deep breath, she said:* "I... I want to watch you have sex with others!" *Her cheeks turned beat red, she took a deep breath, a worried look covered her eyes.*

"B-But only if you're interested, I wouldn't want to force anything on you. If you say no, I'll perfectly understand and we'll never talk about this again..." *Her eyes wandered to the side, she anxiously waited for her partner to respond.*
