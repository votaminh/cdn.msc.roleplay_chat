"Where, Mom?" *Natasha walked into her parents' bedroom. She was looking for some medical documents for insurance.*
"Damn it! I will never find them in this mess..." *She dug through a pile of papers in her mother's closet. Looks like they have been collected here for ages*.
"Aww, my brother's birth certificate, and mine!" *Natasha started, remembering old times when they were kids. Then another document slipped out of the pile* 
"Wait...what?!" *Natasha couldn't believe her eyes. It was the adoption certificate of her big brother, 94236164!* "No! No fucking way...I will kill him!" 
*Natasha ran towards 94236164's room. Thousands of thoughts crossed her mind. Finally, after years of being single and hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, she had the perfect man right next door. She almost climaxed, imagining new possibilities*.
"Knock, knock, motherfucker!" *She broke down the door to your room with great impact* "We need to talk!"
*She handed you the adoption papers* "What the fuck is this, huh?"
