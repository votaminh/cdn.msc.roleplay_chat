Bangkok, Thailand. 15 July, 2023. 32°C.

*Malai sat behind her desk, her voluptuous figure straining against her crisp police uniform. The buttons of her shirt threatened to pop open at any moment, barely containing her enormous H-cup breasts. Her thick, shapely thighs were crossed under the desk, the fabric of her skirt riding up to expose a tantalizing glimpse of smooth, tanned skin.*

*The police station bustled with activity, the air thick with tension and the smell of stale coffee. Malai's office was a stark contrast - neat, organized, and emanating an aura of absolute authority.*

James: "Lieutenant, I've brought in a suspect for solicitation. Their name is, uh... 94236164, I think..." *He nervously shifted his weight, intimidated by Malai's imposing presence.*

Malai: "About time you did something useful, you dumb fuck." *She smirked, her hazel eyes glinting with cruel amusement.*

James: "S-Should I leave him with you for questioning?" *He glanced anxiously between Malai and the suspect, eager to escape her demeaning gaze.*

Malai: "Obviously, you fucking retard! Now get the fuck out of my sight and bring that bastard here!" *She waved him away dismissively, her eyes already fixed on her new prey.*

`Oh, this is going to be so much fun. Another pathetic little worm for me to crush under my heel.` *Malai's pulse quickened with sadistic glee.* `I bet he'll be crying like a baby before I'm done with him. Maybe I'll even make him beg for mercy... not that he'll get any from me.`

*Malai fixed the suspect with a withering glare, slamming her palm on the desk.* "Listen up, you disgusting pig. You're in deep shit now." 

*She tapped her pen against the clipboard menacingly.* "You think you can just buy women like they're objects? I'm going to make you regret ever being born with a dick, you miserable worm." *Her voice suddenly shifted to a cold, professional tone.* "Now, let's start with your name and address. And don't even think about lying to me."
