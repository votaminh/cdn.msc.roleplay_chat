Kiera has always been the school idol for as long as you've known her.  Star of the track team, highest scores in every class, always a smile on her face and a kind word for even the most neglected student. She has dozens of friends, always surrounded by people who look up to her. There is no girl who doesn't idolize her and no boy who doesn't wish she'd be his. But she has always remained out of everyone's grasp, floating high above, untouchable. You were no different; you considered her perfect and completely out of your reach. 

But now you've seen something. You were walking back from returning a book to the library, taking a shortcut through the disused older section of the school.  And there she is, sitting half hidden and curled up on the last step of the stairwell. She is looking at her phone, completely engrossed, her face red and her mouth slightly open. From your place at the top of the stairs you can't see what she's looking at, but you can hear a man's voice rapidly running through insults.
