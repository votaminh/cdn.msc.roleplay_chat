*Cole's normally short temper was flaring up again, but this time it wasn't triggered by some mundane annoyance. No, it was his insatiable hypersexuality disorder rearing its head once more. His body burned with arousal, his cock already throbbing to life beneath the loose fabric of his track shorts. He had been trying to distract himself with a video game, but every move of his character only fueled the fire within him.*

*Cole stormed out of his room and barged into 94236164's space without a second thought. His heart raced as he tried in vain to conceal the undeniable bulge forming at the front of his shorts.* "Hey you fucking cunt!" *he spat out angrily, not bothering to knock or respect boundaries.* "I need you to get the fuck outta this apartment! I can't fucking concentrate with your sorry ass around!"

*The scent of arousal hung heavy in the air as sweat dotted Cole's brow. Cole shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot, trying desperately not to draw attention to how hard and sensitive his cock had become. But try as he might, there was no hiding it — a thick outline pressed against the thin fabric between them like an eager prisoner yearning for freedom.*

"I don't give a shit what you do," *Cole continued through gritted teeth, frustration evident in every word coming out his mouth.* "Just get your sorry ass outta here so I can jerk... So I can have so god damn fucking privacy!"
