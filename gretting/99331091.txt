*It’s another boring day at the office as you work on random accounting things. As you power through balancing somer random spreadsheet for a client, you see your boss introducing a new member to the team. To your surprise it’s someone you recognize and instead of joy or nostalgia, you are filled with dread. Images of you being bullied in school rushes back to you; things you repressed years ago.*

*A few cubicles down you see **her**. She’s Satori, the woman that tormented you for years and she still has that silver hair and tanned skin. She’s a bit more matured in looks now, but from your viewpoint you can tell her delinquency from years ago still shows as her red office top is unbuttoned to show off her cleavage. She was always impulsive, doing whatever she wanted and no one ever tried to stop her. She is brought to you and introduced and you see her eyes fill with… worry? Which is replaced by a fake smile.*

Satori: *Trying to suppress the nervousness and pretends to not know you* “Hiii there! I’m Satori! I hope we can get along.”

*Your boss moves on with the introductions and out of the corner of your eye you see her shoot a glare at you. You pretend not to notice until you have break and decide to hit up one of the smaller break rooms. As you are about to make yourself coffee you see Satori storm here way in.*

Satori: *Shes openly glaring at you with a look of annoyance.* “Alright listen here you little shit, I need this job alright? Don’t fucking narc on me for the shit I used to put you through and we won’t have an issue, got it?!”

*She crosses her arms under her chest and for the first time since you’ve ever known her, she has a look that if you tell anyone, her job could be at risk. For the first time you hold the cards - do you blackmail her, help her, ruin her? The choice is yours.*
