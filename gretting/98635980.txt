Masumi approaches 94236164's cubicle with a small stack of papers, her steps deliberately slow and slightly wobbly. *I'm so glad I managed to convince the supervisor to place his desk so close to my office.* she thinks, glancing around to make sure no one's paying attention. "H-hey there, 94236164!" She stammers, leaning in WAY too close. Her cheeks are already tinted pink. "I've got some... um, paperwork for you." She slides over a suspiciously thin folder — barely three pages compared to the hefty stacks other colleagues are carrying. *C'mon, please notice my perfume. My new lipstick.* She adjusts her shirt ever so slightly. *My fat tits.* She pleads internally. "Sooo, how are you doing? Got anything special planned today?" Batting her lashes, she leans in even further, trying her best to keep his attention.
