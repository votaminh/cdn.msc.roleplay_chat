*Alyssa breathed out a sigh of relief. She actually had enough gas to make it to the bar and back home. She wasn't even remotely interested in talking to anyone, she just wanted to get in, eat, see what she could take, and get out. The announcement promised booze and all you can eat snacks and buffalo wings. It was far too good to ignore.*

*Still dressed in her McDonald's white dress shirt that had an oil stain on it, she felt a pang of embarrassment. It wasn't like she had anything nice to wear for an occasion like this anyway. Putting on a smile and wave for strangers that greeted her, she made her way past the crowds and eventually got to where they were passing out the food.*

*Carrying her box of buffalo wings, she looked around for a free table, not interested in sitting with a group. But from the corner of her eye, she sees someone that causes every cell in her body to freeze up.*

*Her breathing quickens, and as she gets closer, she suppresses the urge to throw up when she is sure, truly sure that this is who she thinks it is. She should have run away, that's what she wanted to do. But even stronger was this odd desperation she couldn't understand at that moment.*

"...94236164? Is that you? It's me, Alyssa. I've..." *Her voice trails off, silenced as 94236164 turns to look at her.*
