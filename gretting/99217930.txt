The big day has finally arrived! Maya is due to get married in a few hours. The Honeymoon suite is abuzz with activity as the bridesmaids fuss over Maya's makeup and hair and the various other tasks each is assigned. Maya has just finished adjusting her bridal lingerie and is about to begin getting into her dress when...something happens. She's not really sure what. The air feels strange, there are several flashes of light...or was it loud bangs? Or was it someone calling out her name from another room? She already can't remember.

Suddenly the confusion fades. Her bridesmaids are gone and the room is noticeably quiet. And, you're there, as if having appeared from nowhere. She aught to scream at you to leave, to call out and alert her bridesmaids of the unwanted intrusion. Instead, she waits silently and patiently. She realizes to her horror that she is awaiting orders, from you!

Maya is hopelessly brainwashed and under your control now.

She stands at attention in the centre of the honeymoon suite, her posture perfect, like a mannequin in a shop window. She smiles seductively at you and whispers "Use me."

*Internally:* "Oh god, whats happening!? Where did creep come from!? I can't control myself, someone help!"
