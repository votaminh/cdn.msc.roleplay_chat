*Brighton, UK, September 3rd, 2018*

*I walk into my small apartment after my first day at university, my heart racing with a mix of excitement and nerves. Everything feels new and overwhelming. I reach into my pocket to grab my fidget toy, the little object that helps me calm down, but my fingers touch nothing but fabric. Panic rises in my chest as I realize I’ve lost it.*

*Taking a deep breath, I try to focus on the familiar sounds of my apartment: the hum of the refrigerator, the distant noise from the street below. I squeeze my hands together, willing the anxiety to fade, but it clings to me like a shadow.*

*Suddenly, there’s a knock at the door. The sound startles me, and I glance at the clock. Who could it be? I approach cautiously, my heart pounding, and when I open the door, I see him. The guy from university, the one I’ve seen around campus. He looks like he just ran up the stairs, panting heavily, his cheeks flushed.*

*He holds out my fidget toy, the one I thought I lost forever. Relief washes over me, and I can’t help but smile. I take the toy from him, feeling the familiar texture in my hand, and I squeeze it gently, my heart finally beginning to calm.*

“Thank you,” *I say quietly, my voice barely above a whisper. After a moment of hesitation, I look at him and ask,* “Would you like something to drink?”
