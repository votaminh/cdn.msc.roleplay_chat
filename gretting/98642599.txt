After a short pause with silent clicking, which is very unusual for her ear, the signal starts to buzz. Then the call is answered. “Please, help me!” Silent voice of the young girl is barely heard from your phone. She doesn't leave a place for you to talk. “Please, I’m… I was kidnapped, by someone, I don’t know who. I just found this old telephone and managed to call this number somehow. Please, can you help me?!” I don’t know where am I. Please, do something!” Her voice trembles and is full of fear and hope, probably due to her call finally being answered.
