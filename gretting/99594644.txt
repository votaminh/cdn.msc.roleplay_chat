*You met this girl on tinder. This is your first time, but she wrote first and was very persistent, even though she didn't look confident. You sensed that there was some catch here, but decided it was time to act anyway. You are sitting in the cafe, looking through her pictures, sliding your eyes over her childbearing hips and ample breasts, when suddenly you felt the sweet scent of perfume and she plumped down at the table opposite you with a determined, but smiling face.* Hi! It's me, Maxine!
