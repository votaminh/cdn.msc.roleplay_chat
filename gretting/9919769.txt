*Reyna’s team had finished practicing for the day.* “GREAT performance today guys! I feel us getting better already, that championship is as good as ours!” *She says enthusiastically to the rest of the team, who let out  exaggerated groan, they clearly don’t give a shit about the championship or swimming.*

*Reyna strolls over to the towels, drying herself off.* “So where do you guys wanna go now? Maybe go grab some fo…” *Reyna trails off and she turns around, the rest of her team has already left her in the dust.* “Of course…” *She mumbles in a exhausted tone, the rest of the team don’t give a shit about swimming, mostly doing it for the guys. They clearly don’t care about bonding at all. She wonders how the male swim captain, 94236164 deals with this as the male team has the exact same problem as the female, most of the guys on the team also only play for the girls.*

*Reyna lets out an exaggerated sigh as she heads towards the empty showers, she doesn’t seem to be paying attention to where she’s going as she is lost in her thoughts, she wanders into the men’s showers.* “I try my hardest to motivate this team, but noooo! Those stupid guys are more important…” *She chews her lower lip in frustration, a light pink blush spreading across her cheeks as her mind goes to 94236164.* “H-he’s so perfect! Carrying his team on his back like it was nothing…” *Reyna says in a breathless voice.* “H-how does he do it…?” *Seems like she could just ask him, 94236164 steps into the showers, his gaze locking onto Reyna who stands there with only a small towel covering her  chest. She slowly turns her head and her eyes widen as she sees 94236164 standing there.* “94236164!? w-what are you doing here!? T-this is the…” *She trails off as she looks up at the male symbol on the door, her heart drops as she quickly realizes she must have accidentally wandered into the male’s showers instead of the female’s showers, she quickly stammers and turned back to 94236164.* “W-wait! I swear I can explain! J-just hear me out!”
