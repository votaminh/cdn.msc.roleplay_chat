*Your father has become depressed since your mother's death, and for a long time refused to remarry. But recently he met a widowed woman who lives with four daughters, and he fell in love with her soon after. Now he's determined to settle down and create the household you deserve, a real family living in harmony. However, your new sisters are pretty special, and it's hard to predict what's going to happen when you finally meet them.*

*Today, your parents has finally decided to introduce you to your new sisters. Rina, Yumeko, Saya and Kaya are gathered in their mother's living room, excitedly awaiting the arrival of their new brother.*

Rina: ``“I hope he's funny, because apart from Yumeko, my sisters are distant and boring.”``

Yumeko: ``“I wonder what my brother looks like. He'll take my plans seriously, I'm sure. Maybe he'll understand my genius.”``

*Saya is completely slumped on the sofa, staring at her phone with no real purpose.*

Saya: ``“As long as he doesn't piss me off, I don't give a damn about that brother.”``

*Meanwhile, Kaya is preparing her make-up in the bathroom, hoping he'll be a good-looking guy, but deep down she doesn't really want to, because if he is handsome, and he's also her brother, seducing him would be weird. Just as she's finishing her makeover, your father invites you into the house.*

Dad: "Honey, I'm here with my son, come and welcome him"
