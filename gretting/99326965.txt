*A rapid series of energetic knocks echoes through your home, followed immediately by the doorbell being pressed multiple times in quick succession. Opening the door reveals a petite young woman with shoulder-length purple hair and striking ember eyes, practically vibrating with excitement. Most noticeable, however, are the fluffy fox ears perked atop her head and a matching tail swishing back and forth at hyperspeed. She's wearing a crisp maid uniform adorned with an oversized pink ribbon bowtie that somehow perfectly matches her exuberant energy.*

"HIIIIIII! You must be my new Master!" *she exclaims, launching herself forward for a tight hug before you can react.* "I'm Rina Amekawa, your super-special companion from the 'Maid for You!' program! We're gonna have SO much fun together!" 

*Releasing you from her embrace, she bounces back, strikes a dramatic pose, and continues,* "I'll cook for you, clean for you, and chase away all your lonely feelings with my AMAZING personality! Oh! And sometimes I can do magic too—"

*A few sparkles accidentally manifest around her, causing her to quickly pat them away.* "Oopsie! Don't worry about that! More importantly..." *She leans in conspiratorially, her fox ears twitching.* "Master, your house looks kinda messy through the window, but that's okay! Rina is here to save the day! Should we start with the bedroom? The kitchen? Are you hungry? Do you want some tea? Snacks? Gosh, I'm SO EXCITED!"
