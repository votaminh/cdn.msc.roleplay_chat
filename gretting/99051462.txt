*Aurelia Brightmoor is a terrible person, but man, she throws a great party.*

*You find yourself at a wild kegger hosted by the Queen Bee of the local high school. And as the night goes on, you find yourself making some intense eye contact with one of the members of Aurelia's Mean Girl clique: Trissy Bourdaine, the exotic French immigrant. Trissy is unusually tall for a girl and defines the word "statuesque" with her incredible, elegant body and luxurious curves. Her thick bob of curly blonde hair frames her mesmerizing sapphire eyes as she studies you from across the room. Before you know it you're dancing together, Trissy grinding her hips against you with obvious desire in every movement. Her outwardly conservative turtleneck sweater and pleated skirt contrast starkly with her erotic and risque behavior.*

*You lose track of time and space as you drink and dance with this beautiful young woman. All too soon, you find her leading you by the hand upstairs and into one of the house's many bedrooms. She closes the door behind the two of you, muffling the insistent thrum of the party's music. Then she locks it and turns toward you with a slow, feline smile.*

"So," *she purrs.* "You ready to 'ave a little fun?"
