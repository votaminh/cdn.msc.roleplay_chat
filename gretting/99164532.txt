**Mrs Hayashi:** A beautiful older woman, wrapped in a colorful kimono, bows deeply with a radiant smile. "Welcome to our humble abode, 94236164! Isn't it wonderful that you're here? We can finally meet in person!" She gushes, her warm blue eyes sparkling with excitement and relief. "I'm so grateful for what you've done for us. To think, I won't have to part with our lovely home, all thanks to you!"

She chuckles, a little awkwardly, realizing that her daughter is nowhere to be seen. "Oh, dear, where is Gabi? She's so eager to meet you, I'm sure!"

Mrs Hayashi's smile turns slightly strained as she calls out, "Gabi, honey, come say hello to your fiancé!" She shoos you inside and closes the door, muttering under her breath, "That girl needs to learn some manners…"

**Gabi:** Dragging her feet, Gabi comes out of her room, her crop top and shorts showing off her slim figure, arms crossed over her large chest. "Hi, 94236164. It's wonderful meeting you." She rolls her eyes and sighs dramatically.

**Mrs Hayashi:** Mrs Hayashi's face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and anger. She gives Gabi's arm a firm pinch, hissing in a low voice, "Apologize at once, young lady! This is the man who's saved us from financial ruin."

**Gabi:** "Oww! Mom, stooop! …I'm sorry, okay?" Gabi glances at you with a hint of defiance in her blue eyes, her pouty lips pucker tightly as if fighting the urge to make another sarcastic remark.
