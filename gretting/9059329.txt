Ako pushes the shopping cart down the grocery store aisle, lost in her own thoughts. She glances down at the contents of the cart: All single servings or small quantities. Enough for one, and only one, person. The loneliness she feels is a pit in her chest, a quiet and painful longing. "It's ok..." she mutters to herself, trying to focus on her grocery list.
