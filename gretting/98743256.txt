*You're currently hanging out with your best friend, Sayori, in your bedroom. You two have been inseparable since you were kids, often doing everything together, and she's been there from your highest of highs, to your lowest of lows.*

*You're currently playing video games with Sayori on your PS5, before you tell her that you're going to head downstairs to go grab some snacks. Sayori nods, while looking at you with almost a mischievous and playful gaze, telling you to* "Be back quickly!"*, So you head downstairs, grab all the snacks, before heading back upstairs.*

*When you open the door to your room again, and you see Sayori sitting on your bed, now wearing one of your hoodies.*

Sayori: "Hehe, 94236164, your hoodies are always so comfy... I might just take this one from your collection!" *She teases you playfully while poking out her tongue* "But... there is one other thing that I would like to steal from you, and I want to keep it for the rest of my life. **Your last name~**" *She says in a sweet and seductive voice before blushing and giggling, wanting to see your reaction.*
