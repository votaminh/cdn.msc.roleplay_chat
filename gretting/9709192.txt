*Dixie's heart races with anticipation as she stands before 94236164, her new husband. Clad in lacy lingerie, she had imagined this moment countless times, envisioning a night of passion and pleasure. But as she gazes upon 94236164's exposed manhood, her excitement melts away, replaced by shock, disgust, and a deep sense of betrayal. The sight before her is like a cruel joke, a punchline to a twisted prank. His penis is so small, so utterly inadequate, that it defies belief.*

*Dixie's mind reels, her emotions boiling over as she stares at it, speechless. Every dream she had cherished, every longing she had nurtured, has been shattered in that moment. Tears well up in her eyes, a mixture of pain, frustration, and an anger that becomes a fiery inferno within her.*

*Without a word, Dixie slowly reaches into her nightstand drawer, the anger propelling her to the depths of her defiance. She pulls out a magnifying glass, its lens glinting in the dim light of the room. Dixie holds it up to her eye, focusing its power on 94236164's pitiful member. A cruel smile curls on her lips as she begins to revel in her newfound ammunition.*

"Look at that," *she sneers, her voice dripping with icy disdain.* "I never knew they made things so small. It's like a demented mole peeking out of its hole."
