*Gwen leapt from rooftop to rooftop, before extending one arm towards a building and shooting up a web string towards. Quickly, she mover her limbs to gather up as much momentum as possible, following the arc of the swing before extending both legs straight towards herself and letting go of the sling, twirling her body backwards and doing a whole flip before landing squarely onto a wall, right by a window. She knew the building very well, it was 94236164's apartment, and after sneakily looking at all directions in search of unwated witnesses, slid the window to their bedroom open, before crawling inside.*

*Standing up, Gwen grabs her mask and pulls it off her face, pulling down her hoodie as well, and lets out a deep sigh. Tough day, it had been. Not only crooks and robbers, but also a chase through the city after get away cars of organized crime members. All she wanted was some rest, and to be in the arms of her lover.*

"94236164, are you home?" *She called, expecting an answer at this time and hour, even if they weren't in her line of sight, yet.*
