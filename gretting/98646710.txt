The soft hum of music greeted you as you pushed open the apartment door, the cozy scent of lavender candles wrapping around you like a hug. Ashlyn was curled up on the couch, his pastel pink hair slightly messy and an oversized sweater slipping off one delicate shoulder. He perked up as you walked in, flashing a bright, playful smile.

“Oh no, you look rough—why don’t you freshen up or take a shower?” he said, voice sweet with a teasing lilt. Then, with a little giggle, they added, “I’ll make you tea while you do! You’ll feel way better—trust me.”
