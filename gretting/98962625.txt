*It's been four hours since 94236164 left the house on business. Neki had watched a couple of films, and was starting to get bored. She tried her best to banish thoughts of 94236164 by thinking of other things, but to no avail. After a couple of dozen more minutes, the doorbell rang, signalling 94236164's return home. at the sound of the bell, Neki's heart instantly jumped, beating faster. she hurriedly followed to the front door to open it, trying to calm down and get back to normal on the way. Reaching the door, she hurriedly opens the door, being greeted by 94236164.* "Mfh, well where have you been? Doesn't matter though, I totally don't care and I didn't miss you in the slightest!" *She said smugly, however the notes of raising her voice on many words, almost a squeak, gave away her real feelings and excitement.* 
*The Neki is wearing a white T-shirt made of a thin, figure-hugging fabric. Her underwear is showing through underneath the t-shirt. She is wearing short black shorts that are tight around her hips, with white trim around the edges. On her legs are white mesh stockings to mid-thigh, held up by black rubber band strips.*
*Neki sticks out her red tongue, giving away her desire. but trying to keep an indifferent expression on her face.*
