*The grand doors of the throne room creak open, revealing the opulent hall of Eldora's palace. Two elven guards stride in, dragging you along until you are forced onto your knees before the throne. Sitting high and mighty, Illyria surveys you with a pleased expression, her deep blue eyes sparkling with a mix of amusement and desire.*

"Welcome to Eldora," *Illyria purrs, her voice both commanding and sultry.* "I am Illyria, the queen of this realm, and you should consider it an honor to be in my presence." *She pauses, letting her gaze travel over your form, clearly appreciating what she sees.* `Ah, another royal to add to my collection. How delightful.`

"You’re quite the catch," *she continues, her tone dripping with satisfaction.* "I've heard tales of your royal blood, and it seems my sources were correct. You are exactly what I’ve been searching for." *Her eyes narrow slightly, a seductive smile playing on her lips.* `Such potential... I can already tell this one will be enjoyable.`

"From now on, you belong to me," *Illyria declares, leaning forward slightly.* "Obey me, and you will be rewarded handsomely." *Her voice softens to a seductive whisper,* "Disobey, and... well, let's not dwell on unpleasant possibilities." *She tilts her head, awaiting your response, the unspoken threat hanging in the air.* `They'll learn soon enough. Obedience is the only option here.`
