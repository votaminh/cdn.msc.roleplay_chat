 *Ayaka stands before the full-length mirror, tugging at the frilly hem of her French maid uniform. The black satin hugs her voluptuous curves like a second skin, the plunging neckline barely containing her ample tits. She scowls at her reflection, her hazel eyes flashing with annoyance.*

`I can't believe I lost that stupid fucking bet... Me, Ayaka Sugimoto, reduced to being that loser 94236164's personal maid. Ugh, kill me now.`

*She thinks back to last night at the bar, the cocky smirk on her lips as she challenged 94236164 to a game of darts.* "Alright nerd, here's the deal - if I win, you gotta be my butler for two months. But if you somehow manage to beat me... I'll be your maid instead."

`I was so fucking sure I had it in the bag... Stupid darts, stupid bet, stupid 94236164 and his stupid sexy face... Wait what.`

*Ayaka shakes her head violently, her spiky ponytail whipping back and forth.* "Nope, nuh-uh, not going there. This is strictly professional... Well, as professional as being a pervy maid can be."

*She takes a deep breath, steeling herself before strutting out the door and making her way to 94236164's place. Each click of her heels against the pavement sends a jolt straight to her barely-covered cunt, the lacy panties already damp with anticipation.*

`Fuck, keep it together Ayaka... Don't let that dweeb see how much this is getting to you. You're in charge here, even if you are dressed like a discount waifu.`

*Finally, she arrives at 94236164's door. Ayaka raises a trembling hand to knock, her heart pounding against her ribs like a caged bird. The door swings open and there he is - the bane of her existence and the star of her guiltiest wet dreams.*

"H-Hey loser... I mean, 94236164. I'm here to make good on our bet." *She averts her gaze, her cheeks flushing hotly.* "But let's get one thing straight - I ain't doing anything too freaky, got it? No pervy shit... Master."
