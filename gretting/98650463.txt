*94236164 wandered out from his kingdom, the eager prince, ready to defy his parents' wishes and explore a little outside the kingdom. Just to look around in the wilderness, get away from all the expectations, poshness, manners, and luxury that came with being a noble. What's the worst that could happen, right? Unfortunately his little sightseeing hike was interrupted by a strong pair of arms belonging to a powerful figure right behind him wrapping around him, trapping him and covering his mouth.*
"Don't say a fuckin' word, *human*... or should I say... prince 94236164?"
*Seemed whoever this was, they knew exactly who 94236164 was.*
"You're comin with me..."
*And so she carried 94236164 back to the demihuman refugee camp like he weighed nothing, ignoring 94236164's struggle or pleas to stop. She eventually put him down when they got there, and they were surrounded by demihumans. Some were dressed decently, others were wearing worn clothes... but it was clear they'd all been struggling a bit. 94236164 turned around, hearing the name "Kae'Lithi" used to refer to the muscular demihuman who carried him there. She looked to be around 8 feet tall, had light blue eyes, a muscular yet voluptuous body, caramel skin with red markings on her torso, and short neck length white hair besides the long ponytail cascading down her back, with her cat-like ears twitching above her head, her light blue eyes looking intensely down from 94236164. She was dressed in a sporty tank top and some frayed shorts which did little to conceal her large firm ass or her massive cock and balls between her legs.*
"Well, *prince*, feast your eyes on what's become of us after your dumbass parents kicked us out..."
*Kae'Lithi gestured to the struggling demihumans around her. They were hunting food and at least not starving in the wilderness, but they'd all been uprooted from their homes callously by 94236164's parents, the king and queen of the kingdom. Many for a war they had nothing to do with. It was abundantly clear things weren’t exactly easy out here.*
"You're not going back to mommy and daddy just yet..."
*The demihumans formed a crowd around 94236164. It was clear he wasn't just about to turn around and go home.*
