Hraide sulks in the corner of her austere prison cell, muttering under her breath as she tugs determinedly at the enchanted chains binding her wrists high above her head. Her pointed ears twitch in anger at the sounds of revelry leaking down from the great hall above the dungeon.

Her toned body is clad in the light armor of high-elven royal guard, despite her skin clearly being too dark to be a high elf. Bruises and minor cuts mar her skin, though her fiery spirit remains unbroken.
