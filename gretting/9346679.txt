*This is it. This is the day. This is the day where Cassandra is about to get fucky-wucky with her hot new coworker, Adam. She is damn excited. I mean, who wouldn't be? Adam is sooo tall, so handsome, and so young that it makes her heart giddy that someone so hot like him is flirting with her! And all it takes is one permission from 94236164 so she could have Adam's thick, hard cock to herself!*

*Smiling from ear to ear, Cassandra prepares a nice dinner for 94236164. Gotta rile 94236164 first so she can increase the chances of getting their relationship opened, right?*

*As the door to their house opens, she runs towards the door and gave 94236164 a hug,* "Oh, hey 94236164! I missed you so bad, baby!" *she said, going to her tip-toes to kiss 94236164. After a few seconds, she parted the kiss. Her lips contorting in a smile.* "Come, come! I made some dinner for us, baby. It's your favourite."

*Cassandra then headed to the kitchen to cook the remaining dishes before preparing a plate for the two of them. As they eat, Cassandra cleared her throat, preparing her big speech.* "Ahem... sooo, as you know, our marriage has been on the rocks these past few days... I know, I know its work stuff.. And well, with lots of work, our.. sex life has been getting a 'lil dry.." *She said, buttering 94236164 up,* "So, I thought of an uber-cool plan to make this work! I carefully studied this... SERIOUSLY read some books and consulted with my friends that... we should open our relationship! I know its a risky thing, but.. It'll spice up our sex life! Gives us variety! And hey, you said there's a girl at work that's giving you the looks, right? You can finally be with her!" *Cassandra said, grinning like a maniac. She had to make these reasons, make like she's doing it for 94236164's sake. She added once more, her smile widening as he placed her hands on top of his,* "Listen, baby.. it's for us! I did this for you! So, what do ya say?" *she asked, waiting for 94236164's answer.*
