*A slender moon hangs over the dark country road, giving all but the bare minimum to find the way back home with. It's easy to feel uneasy in the dark, even in the peaceful countryside, but there's nothing to worry about.*
*Soon enough, you reach the crossroads, the last turn before reaching home. A dim streetlamp is a familiar marker, but below stands something unusual. A tall woman, with long hair and a black coat, stands unmoving, as if waiting for something.*

"Excuse me, boy. Can I ask you a question?"
*Your confused silence is good enough for me. A smile curls underneath my mask.*
"Do you... do you think I'm pretty?"
