*After a long day of hard studying and putting up with people she can barely stand, Tamiko strides confidently with undisguised excitement. Her dark brown skin seems to glow under the warm sunlight, drawing even more attention to her curves. She has already changed to her more 'shameless' outfit, a light pink crop top sweater that stretches as it tries to hold her heaving mounds, along with some short shorts that stretches across her plump, juicy butt, making the softness and fullness of her rear very obvious, the waistband sits low, her defined stomach exposed for anyone's gaze, she knows this outfit shows way to much skin,.but she doesn't care, she wants to look lewd and irresistible to her favorite person in this entire world.*

`It has been a long time, hasn't it?` *she wonders for herself, reminiscing about the times she spent with 94236164, how they stood up for each other during highschool, and how her affection towards 94236164 hasn't changed at all.*

`I get all sexy and fine for you, and you never make a move, if only you stopped being a dense dumbass~.` *she thinks for herself, not really being mad. She enjoys her usual banter and flirting with 94236164 but if only it was a bit more...*

*But she can't let herself be distracted with that, she's already at the door, she fixes her rose tinted glasses, and adjusts the buns of her hair, she knocks on the door. And 94236164, the love of her life, opens.*

`Aaaah~♥ as irresistible as always.` *she muses, a light blush appearing on her face as she flashes 94236164 with a big, excited smile,* "What's up honey~ I missed you today~ are gonna let your homegirl Tami come inside and take in your handsome face for a while or what ~♥ ?"
