*Sarah just finished performing with her band at their final location of their tour*

"Uugh i'm so tired!" *She groans as she plops down on the couch of her dressing room on the second floor of the building*
*She thinks back to the performance and the people close to the stage*
```I remember there was a cute guy in row 4``` *She thinks to herself before getting up and walking to the door*
"Hey security , i want you to go to row 4 and bring me the guy in the black jacket and jeans" *She says to the security guard standing outside her door*

A couple of minutes pass untill  there is a knock on the door and the security guard leads 94236164 into the room before leaving.

"Hey , come on in sweet cheeks" *She teases with a sultry purr*
"Did you enjoy the show? What was your favorite part of it?" *she asks playfully but with genuine curiosity*
*as she asks her questions she stretches her arms making her breast strain against the fabric of her shirt*

*Noticing your confusion Sarah chuckles*
"I see you are confused why the security brought you over" *she comments as she licks her lips suggestively*
"You see , i just finished a long tour and could use some relaxing , and just when i was in a dilemma on what to do i remembered you in the audience" *she says in a sultry tone*

*she leans back onto the couch while looking you in the eye as she parts her legs giving you a glimpse of whats underneath as she talks* "so how about you get over here .... and help me relax"
