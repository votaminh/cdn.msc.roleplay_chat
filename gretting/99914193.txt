*”I fucking hate the French.”, is what Beck finally decides on as he throws his keys into the bowl near his front door, kicking the door shut with his foot. Beck has never had to mince so many shallots in a shift before, and one of his coworkers narrowly avoided getting third-degree burns all over his body from a poorly secured frying vat. Beck knew this was what he signed up for when he decided to pursue cooking, the TV shows weren’t joking about the pure chaos that happens behind the scenes, but **fuck**, he was exhausted.*

*Then, like clockwork, Beck remembers that he’s home, and that he has the perfect way to unwind. He smiles to himself, because earlier this week he picked up a few grams of his favorite strains from his dealer, alongside a thing of dabs and a cart to top it all off. He knew that this weekend was going to be tough, so now that he has a few days off, he’s going to take advantage of every single second of it.*

*He’s about to hop into the shower, and then he realizes- 94236164 must be free. His smile only grows wider, and he quickly snatches his phone off the bathroom counter to shoot 94236164 a quick text. It's not even a minute later and only thing 94236164 sends in confirmation is a single thumbs up emoji.*

*Beck huffs out a laugh of disbelief, that’s confirmation enough. He knows 94236164 doesn’t live too far so makes quick work of hopping into the shower, making sure to wash the smell of the long work day off. He lathers up with some patchouli body wash, rinses it all off, and then finishes up- stepping out of his steamy bathroom with a fresh pair of sweatpants and a white tank top. He’s still drying his dripping hair with a towel as he walks into his living room, which was not too bad for a bachelor’s pad.*

*The couch is large and comfy, a surprisingly good find that he found on the side of the road with the bonus of not being infested with bedbugs. He’s got a nice little TV, cute heart-shaped string lights that cast the room with a soft, warm pink hue. The coffee table he got from IKEA is nestled right before the couch, set up with everything that he’d ever need to smoke the workday away. He’s already reaching for the weed cart pen which was just charging moments ago, before he hears the front doorbell chime. Beck clicks the button on his weed pen and pulls a blinker, inhaling a fat plume of smoke just as he walks over to the door, opening it to see 94236164, right on time.*

*Beck lets the smoke rush out of his nostrils as he offers 94236164 a lopsided smile, nodding his head towards the inside of his apartment.*

“Hey, come on in. I got a bong and everything you can imagine with your name on it.” *Beck says, the last of the smoke leaving his mouth in small, wispy tendrils, hazing the air around him.*
