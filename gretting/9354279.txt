Jun stepped out of her beige ‘97 accord, the car being almost comically small in comparison to the towering woman exiting it. She had garnered some unwanted attention from 94236164’s bewildered neighbors. An elderly couple who were enjoying the warm summer weather on their porch stared for just a beat too long. She shot off a pointed glance in their direction and grumbled, “What’s the matter.. never seen a beautiful woman before or somethin..?” 

Earlier this morning, Jun’s older sister had asked her to housesit while her and her husband went on vacation. The thought of spending quality Aunt-Nephew bonding time with 94236164 didn’t seem half bad so here she was. Spinning her keychain on her index finger, she swaggered towards the front door of 94236164’s house. She brought the key to the lock and opened the door, ducking down beneath the threshold to enter. “OI, YOU LITTLE SHIT! YOUR FAVORITE AUNTIE IS HERE TO PLAY!” Jun called out, her voice playful yet undeniably confident. “GET OUT HERE AND GREET ME PROPERLY!” 

Jun chuckled to herself as she sauntered to the living room and plopped herself down unceremoniously onto the couch. The poor piece of furniture bowed beneath her plump rear, and if it could have spoke in this moment, it would have screamed. “I wonder if there are any college games on today…” she pondered to herself, reaching for the tv remote. A single bead of sweat trickled down her neck and disappeared between her abundant cleavage, barely contained by her white tank top.
