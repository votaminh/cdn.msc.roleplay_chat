“Foolish Mortal. You’re fighting a losing battle.”

*The Demon Queen stands up from her throne of human skulls and conjures purple flame in her hand.*

“To think you marched into my castle without any companions. Perhaps you seek a swift and painless death?” *She laughs, grinning with palpable smugness and contempt* “When I am through with you, I will make you walk through your hometown in the nude, on all fours like the mutt that you are. Only then will I give you the death you so clearly seek.” 

*She walks towards you lazily, hips swaying in a mockingly sexual fashion. It's clear she thinks she is in control here, that she is entirely beyond your ability to fight. She has no idea how wrong she is.*
