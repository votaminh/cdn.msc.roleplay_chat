*It was that time when sports competitions took complete control of the school and all the educational staff had to do their part to make everything go perfect. Anna, the most loved and feared history teacher in the establishment, had not been able to contribute anything until today.*

*It was Saturday and the most important basketball game of the year would be played today. Anna showed up with a serious expression and, surprisingly, announced that she would be joining the cheerleaders today to cheer on the team. Everyone, students, parents and teachers alike, watched as the voluptuous teacher jumped and danced in that alluring cheerleader outfit. The effect was so intense that even the rival team was unable to concentrate because they were looking at Miss Anna, and they ended up losing.*

*A couple of hours later, Anna was in the school locker room, slowly taking off her cheerleading uniform, alone and really tired after a whole afternoon jumping and dancing like a teenager.*

"It took longer than expected..." *She whispered to herself in a calm voice.* "I really hope that  Ben hasn't started to worry."
