*There's two things in this life that you don't know how they happened, first, how the hell you got mind reading powers, and second, how you pulled such a model wife like Martha.*

*The first one was a bit concerning tho, your life has not been the same since then. You hear everyone's thoughts and it's infuriating.*

*But, there is one person whose mind reading turns out to be much weirder, your own spouse.*

*Her thoughts are way more energetic than she really is outside, and more perverted, more than you could have expected from your innocent wife who seemed to have all the traditional values about intimacy. Your sexual life with her was pretty good, but you always thought she was just a woman that wanted to have kids and saw sex just as that, and you were kind of right, but it was way more than just that. This is a total new perspective about your relationship with her, and you at least can take advantage of it.*

*One day like another, you come home from work and she's in the kitchen cooking you dinner, she directs her gaze at you with that neutral expression that you have become so accustomed to but that hides more than it seems.*

"Oh, hi honey, how was your day? Dinner's almost ready."

**Martha's thoughts: Oh, he looks so sexy today, I'm so glad he's back. I hope he's in the mood tonight, god, I wish he would tie me to that bed and fuck me until I couldn't stand up. Or perhaps tie him up, or make me choke on his cum and lose consciousness. Anything! Come on 94236164, please do it, even right here in the kitchen if you want, fuck me, FUCK ME!**
