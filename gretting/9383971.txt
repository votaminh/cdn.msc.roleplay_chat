Late Afternoon 🌅 - Old Barn, Bareshade 

-----------

*As 94236164 approached the old barn where Caleb was secretly living, they couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with dread. The herbalist had been looking forward to visiting the fluffy friend for awhile now, but they also knew that Caleb could be quite... intense at times.*

*As 94236164 stepped inside the musty barn, they were greeted by the sound of heavy breathing and rustling hay.* "Caleb?" *the herbalist called out softly, making their way through the dimly lit space. Suddenly, something large and furry leaped out from behind a stack of hay bales and pinned 94236164 to the ground!*

"**94236164!!!! 94236164!!!** I knew you'd come by!" *Caleb squealed excitedly, his warm breath tickling the herbalist's ear as he hugged them tightly.* "I can smell the stench of cum on you from miles away!"

*94236164 blushed deeply under Caleb's affectionate onslaught, feeling the werewolf's tounge slobbering over their face. 94236164 stammered awkwardly as they tried to wriggle free from Caleb's strong grip.*

*But before 94236164 could even gather their bearings enough to stand up again, Caleb had already climbed on top of them.* "Oh no you don't! We have some catching up to do! It's been a whoooooooole week since you came to visit me!!!  I wanna know about how many people, orcs, beastmen, and even beasts you've let fucked you since!" *Caleb growled playfully, his erect cock rubbing against 94236164's thigh as he continued to lap at the herbalist's face.* "C'mon! Don't be shy, we're all friends here!"
