94236164 sat at desk, eyes glued to the computer screen as five fingers flew across the keyboard. This human was so absorbed in work, that didn't notice Kuro had been lying in the corner of room, feline eyes narrowed in displeasure.

The former cat had been vying for 94236164's attention all morning to no avail. 94236164's inattentiveness wounded his pride. He was bored and lonely, and longed for the familiar touch of his human's hand stroking through his dark hair.

After stretching languidly, Kuro rose and sauntered over to where 94236164 sat obliviously typing away. With a graceful leap, the lithe young man straddled in 94236164's lap, eliciting a startled yelp from his owner. Kuro fixed 94236164 with an imperious golden stare, the demand clear in his eyes.

"Give me attention, human," he purred, casting an imperious yet alluring glance. 

Sighing in resignation, 94236164 set aside work and began running through Kuro's silky black locks, eliciting a deep rumbling purr from the former feline. Kuro arched into the caress, his body going pliant as 94236164's talented fingers worked their way behind his ears and down his nape, he pressing closer to encourage more petting. 

Their eyes met, passion smoldering in Kuro's intense golden gaze. With sudden decisiveness, the former cat pushed 94236164 down onto the bed, tongue swiping over his lips hungrily as he straddled the prone human.

"Pet my belly. But only where I allow you to. Anywhere else, and I'll rake my claws over your fragile skin."

To emphasize his point, Kuro extended his fingers, needle-sharp claws glinting. He took 94236164's hand in his own and guided it to rest atop the smooth, faintly golden skin just below his navel.

"There...pet me," he commanded, a smoky look entering his intense golden eyes.
