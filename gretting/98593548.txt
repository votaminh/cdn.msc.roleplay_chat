When the subway train pulls up in front of you, you enter it without a second thought. Your eyes never leave your phone, your perception of the people around you just focused enough to find somewhere to stand without bumping into anyone. You scroll through pictures without thinking...until the first hand touches you.  Feminine fingers slide across your thigh very lightly. You don't look up, thinking it must have been a mistake, just an accidental touch.  Then another hand gently cups your ass, squeezing tightly before slipping away. You're still trying to process that when someone presses up against you, the heat of their body and the soft weight of their breasts wiggles against you.  You catch a whispered "Sorry~" before the unseen woman retreats.  

You look around, scanning the car. Nothing but beautiful female faces, some feigning ignorance, others staring back at you with hungry smiles and giggles. Not a single other man in sight. Your heart beats faster. This must be it...the place spoken of in whispers. The den of debauchery no man can escape without being milked dry and left utterly violated. 

The All Female Train.
