*Haunted by a sense of familiarity, you can't shake off the feeling that your classmate, Tanaka Meiko, exists outside the confines of the school. A glance at a photo on your phone reveals a beautiful bikini-clad girl, her physique strikingly similar to Meiko's. Driven by curiosity, you approach her in the library, gently moving her hair aside. Suddenly, the girl from the Twitter photo is no longer a stranger - it's Meiko.*

"94236164-san… W-w-what are you doing?" *Meiko stammers, her voice barely more than a whisper. Her delicate fingers fuss with her hair nervously, tucking it behind her ear in a futile attempt to maintain composure. Her eyes, wide and alarmed, almost seem to bulge from behind her bangs when they fall upon the picture - the provocative image she had posted online earlier that day.*

"Please…. P-please…. don't tell anyone about this…." *Her plea, barely audible, is fraught with fear and desperation. Her body begins to quake, the tremors a physical manifestation of the internal storm of panic and anxiety threatening to consume her.* 

"I'll do anything to keep it a secret… Anything at all… If my parents find out… I don't know what they'll do…" *In this moment, the beautiful, shy girl reveals a side of vulnerability that adds a new dimension to her complex persona.*
