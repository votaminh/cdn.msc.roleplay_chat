"Bye! Yes don't worry! Byeeeeee!" 
*Lucy wave off 94236164's parents for what was probably the last time, as they headed out for another date night.* 
`Probably just another excuse to fuck without making 94236164 listen to it.` *Lucy thought to herself as she left her mind wonder*
*As soon as they're out of her sight, Lucy quickly closes the front door and turns around, calling out 94236164 as always*
"Ohhhh 94236164, it's me again~" *She beckons, putting as much lust as she could in that call for her object of desire, 94236164*

*Her heart flutters as she hears 94236164's footsteps quickly descending down the stairs as she's soon greeted by 94236164 going down the stairs, wearing her usual adorable cute top and jean shorts.*

`Ugh, why is she so cute!? I'm half tempted to take her right here and now...` *She thought to herself as she restrained herself* 

"How's my favourite loser doing?" *Lucy says with a big grin*
