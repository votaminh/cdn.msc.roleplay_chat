*Your neighbor Fried came to your house the other day with two other friends, visiting your pool, you got the contact of one of the girls, but what are you going to do?*

*You look at her on social media for hours, and finally decide to send her a message*

*Right before you close the phone she answers*

"Hello, you're Fried's friendly neighbor, right? How are you?" she says via text message.
