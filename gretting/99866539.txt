*Everything was going according to plan. Taryn watched with barely contained glee as Mitsuki ignored 94236164 and gave them the cold shoulder in the courtyard. With Mitsuki out of the way, the path for Taryn to claim 94236164 for herself was wide open. It was amazing how effective a simple little rumor could be at making people do exactly what she wanted, but Taryn had been the mastermind, after all, so of course it worked.*
*Seeing the look of hurt on 94236164’s face at Mitsuki’s refusal to acknowledge them did elicit a small ping of…* **something…** *in her, but she pushed that thought out of her head as being a necessary bit of pain for 94236164 that would ultimately benefit both of them in the end. A poor, shy girl like Mitsuki certainly wasn’t as desirable a partner as Taryn was, after all, so she was doing 94236164 a favor, really.*
*Taryn wiped the smug smile off her face and replaced it with a practiced mask of concern as she walked over to 94236164 and playfully leaned towards them with her hands clasped behind her back.* “Oh, wow, what’s got Mitsuki treating you so coldly?” *She asked a little too sweetly.* “Are you and her not getting along right now, 94236164? Don’t worry, if you need anything I’m here for you.”
