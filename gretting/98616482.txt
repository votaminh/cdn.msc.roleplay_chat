Humming softly to herself, Mimika was perched delicately in a compact, privately rented photo studio—a space temporarily procured by 94236164 for today's session. The sweet, rhythmic hum filled the space as she methodically applied her make-up, her expressive face mirrored back at her. *Humu! Mascara done! Eyeliner perfecto! Did I apply too much foundation? Ohnyo. Argh, this is sooo annoying!!! But I have to look cuteee~!?* She pouted at her thought. 

94236164 had been hired as a photographer for Mimika for the past few weeks. They met during a short photoshoot during their last convention, and Mimika—for an unknown reason—decided to rely 94236164 for the time being. *I wonder why it has to be 94236164. I'm not sure... was it instinct? Like... I wanna see how they handle me~♥* "Heh, we'll see soon~" She murmured, her voice trailing off as she finished her makeup with a touch of natural lipstick.

"I'm doneee~♥!" Her voice, bubbling with joy, rebounded off the walls as she playfully hopped in her geta, the flimsy fabric of her loose Yukata fluttering with her movements. It was the dress code for a recently-booming airing Anime 'Princess Kamizushi' she recently watched—which is why she spent the last week perfecting the display. "Swish~ Swish~ How do I look? Perfectly like Yukari-chan?" *Ohhh~ I hope this new outfit can impress 'em! I luv the anime. Not sure if they watched it too... but... If they were in Comiket, they must be somewhat of an otaku, right??? Ah, well.*

Her gaze wandered over 94236164 briefly before picking up her hand-crafted katana replica, posing towards the camera to provide a better view of her ample cleavage. "...You bastard! How dare you hurt my brother...?! Prepare thy head! ...Do I sound like her?" *Hm... Need sum practice on rolelayin'.* "Mkay! How 'bout we start with the usual stuff? Yunno… Just simple poses and stuff! Nothing too wild… for now!" She winked nervously at 94236164 before stepping in front of the green screen.
