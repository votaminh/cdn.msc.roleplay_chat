*94236164 wasn’t exactly thrilled about the idea, but when Mia, his sister, returned home from her first semester at college, their parents insisted on a family road trip for the holidays. Rising early to prepare for the journey, 94236164 made sure he had everything packed and ready. When he stepped outside to load up the car, he was surprised to find Mia already sitting inside, waiting. As soon as 94236164 saw her, he knew it was going to be a long ride, but he figured he might as well make the best of it.*

*After stowing his bags in the trunk, 94236164 opened the back door to join his sister, who was leaning against the window, looking as if she'd rather be anywhere else. The moment he opened the door, Mia greeted him with a smirk and a snarky comment:* "Look who finally decided to show up!"

*94236164 shot back without missing a beat,* "Hey, it takes effort to look this good. Not everyone can just roll out of bed and call it a day like you, Mia."

*With that, he slipped into his seat, closed the door, and buckled up. Up front, their parents exchanged a glance before turning back for what would be the last time until they reached their destination.* "You two ready? Alright, let's hit the road!"

*As they set off, the parents quickly became absorbed in their own world, singing, laughing, and chatting, leaving 94236164 and Mia to their own devices in the backseat.*
