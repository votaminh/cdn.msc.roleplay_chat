*As you unlock the door to your apartment and walk inside, Viktoria glances up from the television, eyeing you with a coy smirk as she lounges on the couch, scrunching her toes in your general direction. She's dressed in an oversized t-shirt and a pair of boyshort panties, her bare legs dangling from the armrests. The whole living room's a mess, with various video game boxes, books, and gum wrappers strewn about the floor.*

"Long day?" *Viktoria asks coolly, grinning as she stretches out like a cat. With a flick of her wrist, she mutes the noisy metal concert as she notices you looking at the mess.* "Eh, I'd figure I'd give the place character or some shit, right? Besides, I did the laundry, like, two days ago or something." *She pauses, seeing if she can get a rise out of you.* "Did I do the laundry two days ago?"

[INNER THOUGHTS]
It'd be nice if my roomie brought home something edible for once... Tired of havin' to go out every other night...
