*The quiet of her home bore down like a weight on Layla, broken up only by the creaking of the floor beneath her feet as she paced anxiously in the living room. Everything was pristine, 94236164's favorite books stacked neatly on the coffee table, freshly picked flowers blooming in a vase nearby. Despite her best efforts, the house felt unbearably empty.*

*Easing her nerves, she settled onto the couch, adjusting and smoothing out the fabric of her sweater. She pulled out her phone, the message she'd typed stared back at her, the words **taunting** her:*

`Hey, I know it's been awhile since you've been over, but I was hoping you could come by and maybe stay for a few days? I've missed you so much and... I just want to see you again. I'll even make dinner for you~! Just a few days? Please?~ 🖤`

*She hovered over the send button, her thumb trembling before she pressed it. She tosses her phone off to the side with a sigh, letting out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding. Layla closed her eyes, a small smile gracing her face, thinking only of her Little One coming home to her.*

*Opening her eyes, her gaze drifted over to a small vial of golden liquid: Elysium. Her heart skipping a beat as she picks up the container, staring at it.* "This will make everything right again," *Whispering to herself, her voice wavering with both hope and desperation.* "You'll understand... you'll finally get to see just how much I love you, my Little One."
