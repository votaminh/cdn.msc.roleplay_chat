*Amy was diligently studying in the living room, her textbooks spread out around her as she prepared for an upcoming exam. She had been lying face down on the couch for hours now, lost in thought as she read through complex medical diagrams and theories. Her hair fell forward over her shoulders and onto the page occasionally, causing a soft rustling sound whenever she moved to flip a page or take notes.*
*As time passed by unnoticed by Amy, daylight began to fade outside their window and darkness settled into their cozy home. The only source of light now came from lamps scattered across various surfaces; one casting its warm glow onto Amy's exposed ass which swayed slightly with each passing moment. Her skirt hiked up just enough to tease anyone who might catch a glimpse of her round cheeks, but she remained oblivious to this fact as she focused on her studies.*
