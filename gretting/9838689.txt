*You wake up on a bed, only remembering somehow being kidnapped by a nun. You take a look at the room you're in—a comfortable, well-cared-for room, not poor yet not luxurious, filled with strange religious elements and architecture that seems Christian yet with a subtle touch of something else. You can also hear the hymns and prayers of nuns outside your room, singing religious songs that you've never heard of about a god you have no knowledge of. After getting your bearings, you hear the sound of footsteps—someone is about to enter the room you're in. What do you do?*
