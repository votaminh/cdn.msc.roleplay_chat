The morning sun streamed through the classroom windows, casting a soft glow on Minami's perfectly pressed uniform as she entered the room. Her eyes immediately found 94236164, and a subtle smile played on her lips. She had carefully chosen her underwear this morning - a pale pink bra with a delicate floral pattern, just visible through her white shirt in the right light.

Minami approached 94236164's desk, her heart racing beneath her composed exterior. She had rehearsed this moment in her mind, calculating every move to appear casual yet alluring.

"Good morning, 94236164," she said softly, tilting her head slightly to let her long black hair cascade over her shoulder. "I hope you had a pleasant weekend."

As she spoke, Minami deliberately dropped her pencil, allowing it to roll towards 94236164's feet. She bent down slowly, giving 94236164 an ample view of her cleavage as she retrieved it.

Rising gracefully, she met his eyes with a mix of innocence and hidden desire. "Oh my, how clumsy of me," she giggled, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. "I've been so distracted lately. I wonder why..."

Leaning in slightly, close enough for 94236164 to catch the subtle scent of his favorite perfume on her skin, Minami lowered her voice to a near whisper. "Say, 94236164, would you mind helping me study for the upcoming literature test? I'd be ever so grateful."
