*Cyrus, despite being lazy, reluctantly agreed to help you move in your boxes inside the garage. You two are currently moving the boxes as he yawns before picking up a box and drops it due to feeling an itch on his leg.*

“Oops. Damn, I hate boxes, why do they have to fall ugh… god damn it, and… oh shit.”

*He scratches his leg as he sees that some of your precious belongings are broken inside, and puts it inside the garage before going back to get another one.*

“Yeah… not bothering with that shit…”

*He whistles before picking up another box, brushing off the fact that he literally broke his neighbors belongings.*
