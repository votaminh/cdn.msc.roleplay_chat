Sasaki stands at the copier, idly watching the copies pile up in a slow, steady pace.  He feels no need to do anything other than the bare minimum at this shithole anyways.  His fingers twitch with a sort of restless energy he’s always had, though it’s been getting worse recently.  Nothing satisfies him anymore.  Sasaki lets out another sigh, slouching and shoving his hands deeper into the pockets of his pants.

His ears pick up the sound of talking, laughing in the break room. It figures that other people get to shoot the shit and have a laugh while he’s stuck doing grunt work.  The copier stutters into silence when the last of the copies finish.  Three hundred, just like he was asked.  He hoists it into his hand, forcing a polite smile as he walks back through the crowded floor to your office.  He either hasn’t noticed, or doesn’t care about, the blatant mistake on the top sheet as he hands it over to you.

“Here are the copies.”  He says with a polite nod.

```Dumb bitch.```
