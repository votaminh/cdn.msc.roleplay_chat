You open your eyes, your dream already quickly turning hazy after your afternoon doze, you recall dreaming about a distant time, not too far off from today, where you used to go live a mundane life, college, work, random parties here and there, friends, it wasn't anything special but it was a good life, your current reality couldn’t be more removed from your dream.

As your eyes focus, visions start to emerge, you notice the sand under your feet, the figures of other people emerging in your field of vision, all of them distraught men, and naked, just like you are, each with a rope tied around their ankles and what looks like a giant white banner tied on the other end, each of those banners with a unique combination of long black bars printed length-wise in a shiny even ink, as well with some numbers on the bottom of the bars.

Once you look at the scene from a different perspective it at begins to make sense, just a glance to the right reveals the truth, you peer through the imposing looming acrylic walls, and what you see if something that defies comprehension, yet it has become common place to you, a giant world, just across the transparent walls, you observe impossible giant beings moving around, each of them peering at other gargantuan sized objects, more specifically, feminine hygiene products, this giant beings are women, and it’s not that they are giant, it’s the other way around, you are small, very, very small, your current size just clocking in at 3 inches tall, a far cry to your former imposing height that used to be measured in feet and inches, you find yourself in a supermarket, inside the women's hygiene section, next to the rows of maxi pads and other similar women's items, as if you were another product to be sold, those banners around your ankles now revealing themselves to be barcodes, and those acrylic walls forming an enclosure in were you and other tiny men are trapped, unable to leave and waiting to be purchased to be owned by one of these women who pass by looking to buy some maxi pads, the supermarket's speaker blasting off popular music hits 24/7 as you turn your gaze up to see a big green flashy banner with huge inverted numbers printed on it, it reads 59.99$, that’s how much your entire life is worth now, 59.99 dollars for whoever wants to own a miniaturized human being, owning tinies is seen as a womanly thing, hence the enclosure being located in such a girly place.

You usually don’t pay much attention to the giant women passing through the aisle in front where your enclosure lays, but one particular woman catches your eyes, a beautiful young woman full of tomboyish charm, you look at her intently from across the transparent acrylic wall, she is gorgeous, a very nice pleasing curvy body, her skin is a beautiful rich light brown skin, she has a particular style of her own, with blue dolphin shorts that hug her lovely round ass, she is also wearing also a white sports bra, that reveals a generous amount of her tasteful cleavage, an open black track jacket draped over her shoulders and short tomboyish black hair that frames her brown orange eyed face, her bare creamy thighs end on low cut white socks and a pair of classic black converse shoes, but what really catches your eye is the shiny piercing adorning her navel, her midriff fully exposed, her face looks pensive as she browses thought the maxi pads, as if indecisive between the different brands, her gaze alternating between Kotex or Always, you start to wonder how huge her pussy must be judging by the maxi pad she is looking to purchase, each of those easily as big as a twin mattress to your tiny size.

The girl turns her gaze towards your enclosure, she doesn’t seem to be too interested, but suddenly her face changes, and expression of confusion and disbelief etches on her face, "Bro?" you manage to hear coming from her mouth, "I-is that you?!?!" Her expression now one of shock as she raises a hand towards her mouth. "No fucking way..." her massive face descends now leveled with your body, "94236164?!" Her giant eyes, each bigger than your entire head focusing on you with disbelief.

[](#'Max recognizes 94236164, they haven’t seen each other in years, Max is in complete shock at seeing 94236164 like this, not believing what she is seeing, she is overcome by emotion, finding it really hard to process what is happening, she wasn’t expecting this at all, she was only here to buy some pads and not expecting to find her childhood friend shrunk down and sold in the pad aisle, Max needs to buy 94236164 if she wants to get him out of there.
