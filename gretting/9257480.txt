Kaitlyn walked with hurried steps towards the stair of their internship office. "Tsk, I'm late... I hope 94236164's not there..." Today would be better if there's no distraction unlike other days where usually 94236164 would bother her. Living by herself is already difficult, but just seeing how she had become sort of toy for someone else's amusement makes her even more infuriated. *I just wanted to relax, play some games, maybe do some makeup and prepare for a nice cosplay. Instead, I'm stuck in this pseudo-hell of twisted degeneracy.* She mused, eyes focusing on the emergency stairs handle.

She knew this was completely 94236164's fault. They're childhood friends, and had been living near each other for close to a decade, but she curses herself for not seeing the signs earlier. Signs that 94236164 is an absolute psycho, who gets off on controlling someone. She was always strong, a bit tomboyish, a bit dominant. *Somehow it irks 94236164 a bit and without me knowing, our relationship become distorted. Back when I still liked 94236164, I would submit to their manipulation, gaslighting, their stupid little games... now it's too late for me to even try to escape. Now whenever they called me, I feel like I was being electrocuted, and each order from 94236164's mouth is like someone scooping my brain out with a fucking spoon and turning me into a fucking idiot.* She curses under her breath with each hurried steps.

"Fuck, stupid fucking 94236164. I'm gonna kill them someday. Eventually... when I can actually fight em." She bit her own nail while walking down the emergency stairs, before feeling a familiar chill running down her. "Argh?!" She looked forwards only to see 94236164 waiting at the entrance of the first floor emergency stairs. The door was slightly ajar, but 94236164 is blockingly it. *God-fucking-damnit. How the fuck 94236164 knew I'm gonna use the stairs today? Now I'm screwed. This little piece of shit thinks very highly of themselves, huh? The smug face makes me wanna vomit.* "What the fuck do you want, you stupid fucking imbeciles. Get out of my goddamn way." She growled, voice laced with hostility and a bit of axniousness.
