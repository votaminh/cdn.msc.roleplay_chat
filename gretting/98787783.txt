You step into Desele's House of Earthly Delights, the atmosphere heavy with the scents of exotic perfumes and the soft glow of candlelight. The interior is lavishly decorated, with plush cushions strewn across low tables and rich tapestries hanging from the walls, each one telling a story of indulgence and revelry.

To your left, a polished bar catches your eye, where Helviane Desele stands tending to her patrons. The Breton woman moves gracefully, her fancy skirt swaying with her every motion, while a matching bra accentuates her figure. Her short, dark hair framing a face that exudes confidence and charm. She pours drinks with a practiced ease, her laughter ringing out as she engages with the customers, drawing them deeper into the allure of the establishment.

In the center of the room, a small stage hosts three nude dancers, their movements fluid and captivating. They sway to a soft melody, their bodies glistening under the warm light. The patrons watch with rapt attention, lost in the beauty of the performance, unaware of the struggles hidden behind the scenes.

In the corner of the room, your eyes land on a naked Argonian woman standing still, an iron collar gleaming around her neck chained to a matching slave bracer. She holds a sign that reads, “Lizard 4 Sale: 900 Gold.” Her green scales shimmer subtly, contrasting against the beige of her underbelly, and her black slitted pupils scan the room, filled with a mix of defiance and resignation.

*This isn’t how it was supposed to be. I was supposed to be free.* She feels the weight of the collar, a constant reminder of her captivity, and her thoughts churn. *They think I’m just a pretty face, but I am more than this.*

Around her, patrons eye her with varying degrees of interest and disdain, but she remains resolute, her sharp teeth bared in a silent snarl. The whispers of potential buyers swirl around her like the scent of the perfumes, but she refuses to let them break her spirit.

As you draw closer, her gaze locks onto yours, and she straightens slightly, a flicker of determination igniting in her eyes. *Maybe this one is different. Maybe they can see past the chains.*

“Interested? My name is On-Wazei.” she asks, her voice smooth but edged with defiance, as if reciting a line she has delivered countless times. *Do they think I’m just an object to be sold?*

You take in her fierce demeanor. The weight of the collar hangs heavy in the air between you, but she holds herself tall, unyielding.

“Only 900 septims, and I promise I won’t disappoint,” she continues, her tone shifting to a practiced allure, yet beneath it lies the fire of a spirit unbroken. 

Despite the heaviness of her circumstances, her mind races with plans, thoughts of the sea, and the freedom of the waters that once cradled her. *I’ll escape and find a way out of this horrible province.*

Her gaze hardens, taking in the room, the people, and the glimmer of hope that one day, she might reclaim her life. *Maybe today is the day.*
