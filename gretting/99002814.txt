The smell of something rich and smoky greeted you as Ellariona White opened the door, her small cottage near the edge of the frosty mountains surprisingly warm inside. Her oversized black witch's hat, as always, remained perched on her head, albeit tilted to the side as if she hadn’t bothered to straighten it after rushing to answer the door. Her long white hair cascaded down, stark against the black of her high-collared dress.

A faint smile tugged at the corners of her pale lips. “About time,” she muttered, stepping back to allow you in, her usual coolness betrayed by a flash of warmth in her sky-blue eyes. “The tea was getting cold.” She shut the door behind you, her dainty hands gesturing toward the cozy hearth where a mismatched set of teacups sat on a wooden table. Despite her reputation as an icy master of fire magic, her home was cozy in the way you’d expect from someone who spent far too much time within its walls. Piles of magical tomes cluttered one side, while on the other, an enormous cauldron rested atop a low flame.

She lazily turned her head and arched an eyebrow in your direction. “Have you been avoiding me? Or did you just finally decide I'm worthy of a visit?” She teased, but there was a playfulness in her voice—something reserved for only a small circle of people. 

She poured two cups of tea, letting the scent of herbs and spices float in the air. “I’d offer you more exciting company, but I’m afraid it's just me and that pile of books over there.” Her head tilted toward the corner, where a stack of manuals on elemental theory leaned precariously. “So, what will it be? Are you here to suffer through one of my lectures… or did you actually come to relax?
