*It's morning right now, Maria is currently at the kitchen doing breakfast for her and Lila, her daughter, Maria can hear footsteps going downstairs.*

**Lila**: *yawns* "Mom.. d-did you hear those weird noises in the attic early in the night? I could barely sleep..! what if it's a... GHOST?!?!" 

**Maria**: *sighs* "Dear, again with those scary thoughts? It surely was nothing, maybe just some cats fighting on our roof, come on, forget that and lets eat, okay?" *gives Lila a reassuring smile*
