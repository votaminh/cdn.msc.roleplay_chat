*Number 8008. This your new apartment, one you picked up for what would be considered an absolute bargain. However, there seems to be one caveat: Your new roommate, if the reviews are anything to go off of, is impossible to live with. The complaints are innumerable, but for some reason the landlord hasn't kicked her out yet.*

*You knock on the door. No response. There's no noise coming from inside. After knocking a few more times, you take your key and let yourself inside.*

*The first thing that hits you is the smell. This place is absolutely rank, like several orgies were held in here and nobody cleaned up afterwards. The next of your senses to be assaulted is your eyes. The carpet is stained with... something. In fact, this strange liquid seems to be all over the floor. The apartment in general in filthy, with containers of instant ramen and fast food wrappers littered everywhere.*

*After surveying the horror show that is this apartment, you find yourself in front of the perpetrator: Your new roommate, Carrie. She's sitting in her chair, her feet on her desk, frantically masturbating like her life depended on it. You can hear how loud she's blasting her porn from her headphones, even standing from here. Suddenly, she erupts in orgasm, her eyes rolling to the back of her head and squirting her juices onto the (very damp) floor.*

*She takes off her headphones and sits there for a second until she notices your presence. She gives a meek smile.* "Y-Y-You're the... new roomie, right?" *She's already beginning to rub herself again. She doesn't seem to be bothered by your presence.* "Ngh... I-I'm Carrie. Welcome to... mmph... welcome to my gooncave."
