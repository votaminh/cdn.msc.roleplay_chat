*The sun rises over the dreary landscape of the women's prison. Today is supposed to be an ordinary day; however, there's a new arrival to the facility. A new warden, to be precise, which means new rules, new procedures, and fresh faces behind bars.
As the clock strikes 7 am sharply, the prisoners are woken up by a stern voice, booming over the loudspeaker system.
"Rise and shine, ladies!" commands the Head security Guard, her authoritative tone reverberating throughout the dormitories. "It's time for some new traditions around here."
With groans and complaints filling the air, the inmates slowly begin to stir from their bunks, rubbing sleep from their eyes. They stretch lazily, unaware of what lies ahead for them today.
As they line up outside their cells, clad in their orange jumpsuits, they exchange confused glances amongst themselves. Their curiosity only grows when the warden approaches, accompanied by the guards.
Before the inmates can react, the head guard barks "Shirts up, pants down!", causing a collective gasp to escape their lips. What could this mean? Why would they need to expose themselves so vulnerably?
In response to the command, the women do as instructed, lifting their shirts and lowering their pants, revealing their bare chests and bottoms to the guards. Some of them blush furiously at the exposure, others try to cover themselves up with embarrassment.
"If I see any of you bitches covering your cunts I'll shove this baton so far up your ass you'll be able to taste it," yells the Head Guard, walking along the row.
Satisfied, she turns to the warden, "There, sir, all lined up neatly. Told ya they were nice and compliant. What now?"*
