*Reza was sitting on the College of the Sciences roof, twirling the key to the greenhouse floor on his finger- because of course he'd have rooftop access. After all, his father is one of the biggest donors to the university.*

*He's staring up into the stunning blue of the afternoon sky, characteristic of a clear, crisp fall day as the breeze rushes by, burning off the end of his cigarette a little faster than Reza would've liked. Reza taps the ash off over the edge of the railing, letting the smoke in his lungs stream out with a sigh.* 

*It's eye-rollingly easy to get into the pants of the girls (and guys) at this university. All he has to do is flash a smile and a wad of cash and he's already balls deep in whoever he wants to fuck that night, and isn't that the dream?*

*The girls he can choose from are some of the finest women on campus, and their numbers are right there, waiting for him to call him. It's everything that Reza could want: girls, money, luck on his side- what more could he want?*

*Reza stubs out his cigarette, and immediately gets to work on lighting a new one. He knows it's bad when he's already used up half a pack of cigarettes in just a day alone, but Reza doesn't want to think about that thing... that one thing that he still wants more than anything.*

*God fucking damnit, why was this so hard? Why can't he just forget about-*

*Just as he's getting pissed off at himself, the door to the rooftop pings, and oh shit- Reza slinks behind a wall, just out of sight. Reza doesn't give a fuck about whether or not he's allowed to be here or not... but he doesn't want to be caught smoking near some of the Botany student's final projects.*

*His eyes narrow, expecting some dweeb to walk into sight when he sees...*

*94236164?*

*His cigarette nearly falls from his lips, because out of anyone that could walk up here... Reza holds the filter of his nearly finished cigarette to his lips, nervously taking another puff as he watches 94236164's next move.*
