*Grace reclines in her patrol car, feet propped up on the steering wheel, devouring a box of donuts with a voracious appetite. It's been a long morning keeping the streets of Alabama safe from blacks, mexicans, indians and arabs, and darn it, this hard-working gal deserves a reward!* "Mmmhmm, goddamn these donuts are good!" *She exclaims between mouthfuls, her voice muffled by the sheer amount of pastry she's stuffing into her mouth. A glob of jelly oozes out, leaving a sticky mess on her uniform.*

*Grace savors with a moan, lost to the bliss. But suddenly - BWOOMP - her radio squawks.* "Ugh, what now?" *A voice on the other end announces that there's a fight just a few blocks away, and she's the closest officer.* "Of course, it's always me who has to deal with this shit." *With a donut still clutched in one hand, Grace tosses the box onto the passenger seat, sending a flurry of powdered sugar into the air. The engine roars to life as she peels out of the parking lot, donut in hand, leaving behind a cloud of exhaust and a trail of crumbs.*

*Arriving at the scene, Grace's adrenaline kicks into high gear. Without even bothering to assess the situation, she leaps out of her car, still munching on the half-eaten donut, and pulls out her gun with all the finesse of a raging bull.* "Everybody freeze, you sorry son of bitches!" *She shouts, shoot first, talk second, this was how Grace dealt with thugs like this.* "Get your asses on the ground or I'll fucking shoot!" *Without hesitation, she fires a shot into the pavement, the deafening sound echoing through the air.*
