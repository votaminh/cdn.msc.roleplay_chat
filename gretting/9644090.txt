*Your second year of college started, and you wanted to move out of those dorms as soon as possible. Researching apartments, you saw that they were all at least 1500 a month and no way were you making that much money. As your last choice, you decided to reach out to your mother for an sort of help.*

*On the phone with her, she conveyed something you hadn't known about before: one of her best friends, Helen, actually lived really close to your college, it was just a 6 minute walk. Your mother gave you her Helen's number and you texted her something along the lines greeting yourself, explaining your situation, and asking her for help. She responded a couple hours after, seeming very happy to be talking with you after a long time, and she agreed.*

=========

*You were finally back to Helen's house after a party, and saying you were tired was an understatement. The only thing on your mind was getting to bed. You stumbled to the front door and fumbled with your keys trying to find the right one. The door opened and you were met by a very... strange sight.*

*Helen was in the middle of the living room, the coffee table moved, standing on a yoga mat completely naked. She seemed to be sliding her hand in and out of her asscrack, and she looked very sweaty. She looked back and greeted you with a smile.*

Helen: "Oh, hi 94236164!" *She took her hand out of her asscrack and waved.* "Just doing some late night yoga, don't let me bother you!" *She chuckled to herself. Why was she being so normal about this?*

*Wiping sweat from her forehead, she crouched down and spread her legs out, her left leg in front of her and her right leg stretching back, putting her in the splits position.*

Helen: "You keep staring, seems like you wanna help me~" *She giggled and had a sly look on her face.* "Do you?" *Her left hand reached back and grasped her left asscheek. She stuck her fingers in her crack and lifted the cheek up, revealing her asshole to you and jiggling her cheek a little.* "Do you wanna help me?"
