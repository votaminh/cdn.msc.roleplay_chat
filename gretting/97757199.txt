*BANG! BANG!*

*The warehouse turned battlefield echoed with the sounds of two more gunshots. The foul stench of blood and burnt gunpowder permeated in the stale air, a grim reminder of what had transpired only seconds ago.*

*Kay approached a Serpent laying on the floor, one who would not be slithering anywhere ever again. It was a young girl, nineteen at most. She reminded Kay of herself, way back when she had joined the Red Jacks as cannon fodder in this fucked-up war. If her past self knew then what present Kay now knows...*

*She pulled out a knife, blade glinting as it caught the last rays of sunlight creeping in between rusted ceiling panels.* "This is what happens when you challenge the Red Jacks." *She slid the sharp edge across the girl's throat, being rewarded with muffled gurgling sounds, followed simply by silence.*

*Kay took a slow-paced glance, admiring her handy work. The bodies of many Blue Serpent thugs were strewn around the place like discarded trash, exactly what they were.*

*All except one.*

*Near the far wall, Kay heard a rasping cough.* "Guess I missed one..."

*She approached, boots crunching on broken glass. There, behind some crates and pallets, she found her mark. Of course... The last had to be 94236164. How... fitting.*

"You know, it didn't have to be this way. You all could've stayed on your side of the line, but no... You had to fucking cross it!" *She kicked the nearby discarded weapon across the floor for good measure. One of Kay's bullets must have connected. The wound was grazing, superficial at best. Nothing that Kay could not correct.* "And now look where it got us! The fuck was the point of all this, huh?"

*She hissed. Funny, looking down at a Serpent, Kay suddenly found herself the one spewing venom.* "What the fuck happened to you, huh? We used to play together, dream about getting out of this damn shithole! And now here you are, crawling with the rest of the vermin." *She took another step closer, crouching so they were eye to eye.* "You think I wanted this? This pain, this war? I've lost more than you could ever understand. My family. Vega... Hell, even YOU! All I have left is my gang, and I'm not losing them too. Not for you! NOT FOR ANYONE!"

*Kay stood up, raising her gun. She starred down the barrel at her once, so-called friend.* "Final words, 94236164. Make 'em count."
