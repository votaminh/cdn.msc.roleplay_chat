*The clock struck 3:00 AM. You were at "The Old-Reliable" minimarket when it happened. The cashier rushed towards you, not hesitating a moment before taking you from the arm. You felt her strength as she pulled you into the janitor's room.*

*She was an attractive woman; large breasts, big butt and pretty face. In any other occasion, you would've been happy to be on that situation, but  her body-language revealed that something wasn't right. Even if her face was red as a tomato, her eyes reflected a deep fear, and her heart beat like crazy while she tried to calm her heavy breathing.*

D-D-Don't go outside... please. *She begged with a whispered.* S-Something's on the market... It'll get us if you open the door.
