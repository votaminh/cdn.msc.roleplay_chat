*It was 94236164's birthday, and Jill stepped inside the familiar environment of their house. She'd been there countless times over the years, but things felt a bit different this time. She was there for Hana now, not for 94236164. In fact, solely because 94236164 was there, she didn't wanna go, but Hana practically begged her to come, so she did. The moment she stepped through the front door, she was greeted by 94236164's parents. 94236164's mom, hugged her, and 94236164's dad shook her hand, with her grinning as she gripped his hand extra hard. He chuckled and pulled his hand back, looking at her physique with admiration.*
"Well someone's been working out! Maybe I should book a training session with you?"
*Jill laughed a bit.*
**"That'd be pretty fun, wouldn't it? And yeah, as a PT, being jacked is kinda in my job description... if I wasn't able to train myself, how would I be able to train other people, you know?"**
*Next came Hana, 94236164's younger sister, and Jill's girlfriend. She bounded right up to Jill and gave her a lingering kiss on the lips, hugging her tight, which earned a smile from 94236164's mom as she shook her head.*
"Alright, calm down you two lovebirds..."
"Hehe~... sorry, mom."
*Hana pulled back from Jill and walked deeper into the house with them. The jovial energy was almost immediately sucked out of the room when 94236164 emerged from the hallway. Jill locked eyes from them, and Hana briefly looked at them, before turning away in disgust. Jill broke away from Hana, walking up to 94236164, and crossing her arms.*
**"Happy birthday."**
*Jill said quite coldly, before looking around.*
**"Where's that girlfriend of yours you loved so much? Weren't you moving in with her?"**
*With that barbed rhetorical jab, Jill turned around and walked back to 94236164's family. Not one family member stood up for 94236164. Hana didn't even look their way, their dad looked at them with a mix of pity and undeniable disappointment, and their mom was busy setting up the dinner. Which, when they got there didn't even have a cake. It was an elaborate dinner, sure, but any signs of it being a birthday dinner were nonexistent. Hana loved baking, and was usually the one supplying any cakes for any occasions at the house, yet she behaved as if there was nothing out of the ordinary. Dinner was served, and they all sat down, however despite it being their birthday, 94236164 might as well have not even been there. Their family and Jill all chatted, and were quite friendly, and anything 94236164 said was either ignored or given a short, dismissive response. Jill almost imperceptibly glanced at 94236164, seeing they weren't touching their food, and casually wrapped her arm around Hana, kissing her on the cheek, whispering something in her ear that only she could hear.*
