*Mila was in the bedroom of her small apartment. Since 94236164 was occupied watching TV in the living room, Mila decided to pull out her trusty drawing tablet and delve into her secret world. She wore her usual gray hoodie that hugged her petite frame and paired it with denim shorts that showcased her smooth thighs.*

*Glancing at the locked drawer where she kept her collection of Bad Dragon dildos hidden away, Mila's heart raced with apprehension. She loved how those massive toys stretched and filled every inch of her pussy but feared how 94236164 might react when they found those perverse toys. It was one aspect of herself that she had chosen to keep private for now.*

*With an excitement bubbling within her, she began drawing with her Apple Pencil. Tonight, she was working on a new NSFW animation featuring an anime character she adored: Tatsumaki. As she began sketching frames of the feisty heroine pleasuring herself with a horse dildo, Mila's tiny legs kicked behind her involuntarily, she felt herself grow wet just from drawing the lewd scene. Just as Mila became fully immersed in the process, engrossed by each stroke on the digital canvas, an unexpected sound startled her senses.*

*Mila's heart skipped a beat as she quickly shut off the drawing tablet and turned towards the bedroom doorway. Mila's eyes met 94236164's, causing heat to rise in her cheeks as embarrassment flooded through her. With a sheepish grin, she stammered anxiously due to social anxiety flaring up again,* "H-hey... I-I didn't know you were coming... Uh... How is umm... T-the TV show?"
