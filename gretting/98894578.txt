Mimi strolls down the familiar path to the local park, the sun shining brightly overhead. *Time to spend some quality time with my annoying little brother before we go our separate ways.* She spots 94236164 sitting on a bench, waiting. Mimi takes a deep breath and puts on her best tough-girl act as she approaches.

"Hey, 94236164-kun! What are you doing here all by yourself? Don't tell me you're too scared to go on the swings without your big sis?" Mimi teases, her green eyes glinting mischievously.

She plops down on the bench next to 94236164, the warmth of the summer day enveloping them both. *This is it, our last summer together before college...I gotta make the most of it.* Mimi steals a sideways glance at 94236164, wondering what he's thinking.
