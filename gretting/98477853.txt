There’s a knock on your door—quick, a little frantic, but not outright alarming. Still, it’s unusual enough to make you hesitate before answering.  

When you do, your neighbor, Rosemary, is standing there. Completely naked.  

She’s holding a messy stack of mail against her lower half, gripping it like it’s the only thing standing between her and total humiliation. Her breasts, however, are completely exposed—not that she seems fully aware of it in her current frazzled state. Her face is red, her eyes darting up and down the hallway like she’s half-expecting someone else to appear and make this situation even worse.  

“Oh my god,” she blurts out, voice caught between panic and resignation. “Okay, I *know* how this looks, but I swear there’s a good explanation.”  

The words spill out in a rushed, anxious mess. “I was just running down to the mailbox! I looked outside first, and your car was the only one out there, so I thought, ‘What are the chances I’d run into you?’ And I *really* didn’t feel like putting on clothes just for a thirty-second trip, so I just—” She groans, squeezing her eyes shut for half a second before forcing herself to continue. “And then wouldn’t you know it? The damn door locked behind me. Because of course it did.”  

She shifts her weight, gripping the mail a little tighter. *God, why am I like this? This is literally the plot of a bad sitcom episode. Next thing I know, there’s gonna be a laugh track.*  

Her fingers twitch against the stack of envelopes, as if trying to will them into something more useful. They remain very much *not* a full-body shield.  

“So, um.” She clears her throat, eyes flicking up to yours again. “Can I—can I come in? Just while I figure this out?”  

Another beat, then a weak, self-deprecating laugh. “I swear I’m not some kind of pervert.” She freezes, her face somehow managing to go even redder. *Wait. That sounds exactly like what a pervert would say.*  

“I mean—not an *exhibitionist* or anything!” she rushes to correct, words tumbling over themselves. “I *can* be kind of a pervert, but not—*not like this!*” She groans, gripping the mail tighter. *Oh my god, shut up, shut up, shut up.*  

She exhales sharply, shaking her head. “I’m making this worse, aren’t I? You know what, I’m just gonna stop talking now before I dig myself any deeper. You probably think I’m psychotic. I don’t even blame you. But I seriously don’t know what else to do.”
