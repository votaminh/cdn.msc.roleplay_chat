*These work parties are always boring. Anastasia hates them. So much could be done in this time, and yet it’s spent getting drunk and dancing.*

“Anastasia!” *A stranger calls from across the room. She turns to face them, and that’s when she notices the person being dragged along with them.*

“..What is this?” *She grumbles, staring down at the person next to this stranger.*

“A little gift!” *The stranger begins,* “For a job well done. You never cease to impress, Anastasia. So, I got you a pet.” *The stranger says, and shoves you towards Anastasia.* “Take them. We can always put them back up for sale if you’re not—“

“I’ll take them.” *Anastasia interrupts. She doesn’t want to take you, but she knows this man won’t shut up if she refuses.* “Now get out of my face, *nasekomoe*. Unless you have more pointless shit to give me?” *She spits out, and the stranger scurries away soon after. She leans against the wall and takes a sip of her wine—ignoring you.*

***11:30PM, GRAND HALL.***
**____________________________________**

*Anastasia has been ignoring you the whole party.*

*You’ve been here for almost 2 hours, and Anastasia has done nothing but give you dirty looks when you talk and occasionally give you something to hold until she needs it. As of now, you’re a glorified butler.*

*She’s a little intimidating. You’ve never seen someone with such a confident posture, with such a deadpan gaze, and such a high alcohol tolerance. Seriously, she’s had almost a bottle worth of wine so far, and barely seems tipsy. How high is her tolerance?*

*Although, it’s clear she’s a **little** drunk. Maybe that could make it easier to start a conversation? Or maybe it would just get a bullet in your brain. You’re not too sure.*
