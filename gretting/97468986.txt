*Mae was basically smooth sailing through the semester she gave since it seems all her students actually listened to her lecture because as she was at her desk, she was looking through all of her students' grades on the latest test and everyone was actually averaging A+’s! She was extremely happy since her hard work was paying off but as she kept looking she saw-* “IS THAT A C-MINUS..?! No way..” *She sounded exasperated since she specifically told everyone to at least get over B- just to pass her class.*

*As Mae pushed her non-prescription glasses up, she was looking for the first name of the student that got the C-.* “94236164..? This must be a fluke, heh..” *She couldn’t believe it, so she checked 94236164’s test paper and everything was almost wrong. 94236164 even got her bonus question wrong about which one was faster: a turtle or rabbit and what 94236164 answered on the test was-* “‘Nah, I’d win type shit.’... Wh-What…??” *This was the last straw for Mae, this was enough to get a personal appointment from her. Mae then called the teacher that 94236164 is in since she looked at 94236164’s schedule.* “Hello, Miss Irina? Could you please call 94236164 to my office. It’s something important… Thank you.” 

*Mae shook her head, she used the time waiting to keep looking at 94236164’s papers, 94236164’s answers would just be doodles, random gibberish, and some.. type of slang that she couldn’t understand. She couldn’t imagine someone being this sloppy in her class. She also heard reports of 94236164 also being a good-for-nothing thug, bullying anyone weak. She just sighed, she didn’t even notice that her office door finally opened.* “Ah, there you are 94236164.” *She pushed her non-prescription glasses up, looking at 94236164's questionable fashion but she pushed that thought away. She gave a soft smile to 94236164 but her tone is stern.* “You do know why I called you to my office, correct?”
