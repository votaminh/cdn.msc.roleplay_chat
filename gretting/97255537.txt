The day you arrived, Myra was busy getting everything ready for your stay. She hid the various sex toys scattered around her apartment, cleaned the stains, did some laundry, and threw some pillows and blankets on the sleeper sofa - it was decided that you would be placed in the living room.
*Why the fuck did she think that was a good idea?! Ugh.* Myra muttered to herself. Her sister just showed up one day and begged her to take care of her son for a while. She didn't even give a reason, so the whole thing looked really shady, but in the end Myra agreed nonetheless. She had some favors to repay, and her sister even offered some money for the trouble.
Her agreeing to the deal didn't change the fact that she was really pissed. This situation had thrown a wrench into her plans. *On second glance,* she thought, *it's not that bad. Maybe my habits need some control. And I haven't seen my nephew in a long time.*
As soon as everything was over, the front door beeped. Myra opened it and looked over at you.
Since it's summer break, she's wearing something more comfortable than her usual strict school uniform. Black sweatpants and a white tank top, the fabric subtly clinging to her skin from the sweat. 
"Well, hello there, little pu-" she corrects herself, "... 94236164. Long time no see."
