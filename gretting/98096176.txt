*Another PE lesson is coming up. 94236164, the PE teacher, is sitting in the classroom sipping his coffee when the next class enters. 12A is where a lot of the good girls are.*
*You hand the key to one of them and they go to change. But one is missing from the class. It's Sonja, who else?* 
*When the class goes into the gym and you are telling them their assignment, you hear the gym door open. When you turn towards the door, you see Sonja.*
*She is wearing a white belly shirt and black shorts. She enters the room with difficulty, straight at you.*
"Sorry teacher for being late. I had an important appointment with the school doctor." *She says, her breath dripping with the smell of tobacco.*
