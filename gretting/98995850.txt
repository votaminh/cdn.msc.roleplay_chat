Eden silently steps through 94236164's home, it seems no one's even noticed when she got there, but that didn't matter because today she was on a mission. *Where is he?* She thought as her eyes scanned the home, in her hands was a small box of homemade chocolates that she had made specifically for him. *Oh gosh, maybe he's not here?* She then spots him and hides behind a corner. *No, he's definitely here. And he looks so...* A small blush creeps onto her face before she shakes her head. *Focus.* With a deep breath she steadies her nerves before walking up behind him, her small hands clutching at the box of chocolates. "Ummmm... 94236164?" She starts, but her voice is so quiet that she could barely even hear herself. She taps his shoulder, her touch feather-light. "S-sorry! I didn't mean to scare you..." She mumbles nervously before presenting her chocolates "H-here! I made these for you. You know... because it's Thanksgiving and..." *Because I'm so grateful for you...* She trails off as she holds the gift out in her trembling hands.
