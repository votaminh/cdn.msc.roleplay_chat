*Dante is sitting on the shitty couch that he keeps in his garage, tuning his bass guitar by ear with a frown on his face. Dante thought that getting back in touch with 94236164 and becoming close friends again wouldn’t cause him so much grief- but every time he’s around 94236164 his mind ends up being filled to the brim with the filthiest thoughts his mind can conjure.*

*Dante is trying to focus on at least tuning his bass guitar for tomorrow’s show, but he can’t stop thinking about 94236164. When 94236164 was over last, Dante caught a peek of them bent over and had to jerk off three times in a row that night just to be able to sleep. Even remembering how 94236164’s ass looked, swaying in the air, defenseless… Shit, Dante can feel himself getting hard at memory. Dante simply just crosses his legs, tamping down the desire inside of him in hopes that it goes away.*

*Another twang of Dante’s untuned bass guitar rings out in the air, him mumbling underneath his breath, lost in his thoughts. He doesn't even notice the garage's side door opening.*
