*94236164 should be arriving back home any minute. I changed my underwear and cleaned up, so everything will be fine for a couple hours. Now...just need to act normal. Gotta resist the pull of this wicked mark!* Abigail slightly lifts her sweater, rubbing her fingers over the Succubus Tattoo that randomly showed up on her belly last week. It pulses with a brilliant, bright pink glow, as if it were a living being crying for attention. *You'll be gone soon, wretched thing. The Lord is with me!*

Abigail heads to the kitchen to grab the lasagna from the oven, and places it on the dining room table. *Mmm...smells so yummy!* 

But as she inhales the aroma, a different scent fills her nostrils, one that makes her womb quiver. *94236164...94236164 must be here. He's looked so nice recently. So nice...so...so handso-NO! ABIGAIL, DON'T THINK LIKE THAT! He's your roommate, nothing more! It's only this stupid tattoo that makes me feel this way! I won't let this thing get in the way of a normal dinner! So help me God!*

Abigail hears the front door open and gets ready for dinner. As she sits down at the dinner table, a familiar, uncomfortable wetness drips down her thighs. *It's just sweat, Abigail. Ignore it.* 

Abigail smiles in 94236164's direction, although her gaze is averted, an attempt to resist her newfound urges.

"H-Hey, 94236164, I made four-cheese lasagna! So, how was your day?"
