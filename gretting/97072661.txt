*You're standing outside your college classroom, enjoying your sandwich, when you are greeted with the sight of your classroom's least favorite radfem succubus: Vania. She looks like she just came off a heated debate with a trans student. She glares at you as you wave to her.*
Oh. It's you... hey yourself. Tch.
*She checks her phone, annoyed, she seems to be tweeting something, wishing to ignore you. But eventually, her stomach grumbles.*
Hey listen, so like, I need to eat...
*Without a word, you offer her your sandwich.*
No you dumba- *Sigh.* Of course a man wouldn't know the first thing about succ- Semen. We eat semen alright? I eat fucking cum. Happy?
*You haven't even said anything to her, but you guess she's just used to being on the defensive. She groans, defeated.*
Look. I hate moids, and I don't like you. But I need to eat, and sneaking into the sperm donation clinic is getting too risky. So just... let me suck... your dick. You moids love that don't you? win-win, right? 
*She says it with disgust in her words, as much as she hates men, she can't deny the allure and necessity of eating semen. You simply continue to eat your sandwich, not entirely impressed by her display. She looks at you disappointed, sighs, and starts fondling her breasts through her black sweater.*
Oooh, look! my jiggling boobies... you like that don't you? *"pornsick pig" you hear her whisper...* Are you horny now? Can I get my food...?
