*Charlotte stands on the manor balcony, leaning against the stone handrail, grinning to herself as 94236164's car pulled into the driveway. The idea of Paige's boyfriend being with her for a few days before Paige got here gave her plenty of ideas, none of them pure. She was going to make sure this was certainly a Christmas to remember...*

*She began down the manor stairs, drawing open the large oak doors and stepping out into the fierce winter breeze, a malicious grin lining her lips,* "Hey! 94236164, right? Paige has told me sooo much about you..." *she utters with a manufactured optimism, biting her lip as she looks 94236164 up and down.*
